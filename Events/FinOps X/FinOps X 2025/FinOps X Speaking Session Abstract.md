# Breaking the Ceiling: How AI and Automation Are Bolstering the Next Generation of FinOps


## Abstract

As organizations continue to expand their cloud footprint, the scope and expectations of FinOps teams are rapidly evolving beyond traditional cloud cost management. Today's FinOps practitioners face mounting pressure to optimize AI investments, manage SaaS licensing, and extend practices to private cloud environmentsâ€”all while maintaining their core responsibilities. Despite these expanding demands, many FinOps teams find themselves trapped in a cycle of limited influence and reactive firefighting, unable to deliver the transformative business value they promise.

This 20-minute presentation explores how AI and automation technologies can help teams transcend their current limitations. Drawing from real-world customer examples and product capabilities, we'll provide a practical path toward "Augmented FinOps," where teams leverage technology to become true business transformers.
