# Voice of Customer (VOC) Tactics for CloudBolt

Based on the meeting notes and the Productboard guide, here are practical VOC tactics to address the customer feedback challenges discussed in the CloudBolt-StormForge integration meeting:

## 1. Establish Regular Customer Listening Posts
- Implement monthly reviews that track customer feedback trends across product lines 
- Create dedicated channels with StormForge customers to gather integration feedback, similar to the Teradata example from the meeting
- Schedule regular customer check-ins to prevent the "out of sight, out of mind" scenario that Ryan mentioned happening with DXC

## 2. Develop Clear Customer Segmentation Strategy
- Use the "Customer-Value Weighting" approach from the guide when prioritizing integration features
- Focus on high-value enterprise customers like the "top 10 accounts" mentioned in the guide that represent significant revenue
- Create specific segments for HCM+Kubernetes users versus standalone users to better target integration efforts

## 3. Create a Unified Feedback Repository
- Establish a centralized location for all StormForge and CloudBolt customer feedback
- Implement the "single source of truth" concept from the guide
- Use this repository to drive the planned April 14th meeting for identifying integration opportunities

## 4. Implement Structured Cross-Team Communication
- Create the "customer insight newsletters" mentioned in the guide to keep all teams informed
- Establish cross-functional forums that include sales, marketing, and product teams
- Share customer stories in company all-hands meetings to showcase integration value

## 5. Connect Integration Decisions to Business Metrics
- Link customer feedback to specific ARR goals, like Frank's concern about churn
- Use the "Customer evidence" framework from the guide when presenting integration priorities
- Quantify how integration features impact customer ROI (similar to the example of saying "save 15 hours per week")

## 6. Set Up Progress Monitoring
- Establish clear metrics for integration success similar to the "checkpoints" recommended in the guide
- Monitor customer sentiment through regular surveys
- Track adoption metrics for cross-selling opportunities

## 7. Enable Customer-Driven Webinars and Community
- Support Frank's planned webinar focusing on HCM roadmap including Kubernetes integrations
- Create a shared portal where customers can vote on desired integration features
- Establish a customer advisory board specifically for integration feedback

## 8. Develop Customer-Centric Pricing Models
- Address the pricing concerns by creating clear ROI models as mentioned in Will's comments
- Develop calculators to demonstrate cost savings from the integration
- Use customer feedback to refine the combined pricing approach
