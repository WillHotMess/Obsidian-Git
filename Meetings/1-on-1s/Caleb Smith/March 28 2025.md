## Discussion Notes

### Career Progression

- Both attendees recently received promotions
    - Caleb Smith promoted to Senior SDR after 2.5 months waiting
    - William Norton promoted to VP of Marketing
- William discussed the extended leadership team structure being formalized under ECOM
    - Team includes Ryan Wren, Frank, Nick, Matt, Augie, and others
    - This structure partly relates to StormForge acquisition and integrating their leadership

### Professional Development Philosophy

- William shared his approach to the VP role:
    - Not just doing more of the same but elevating performance and thinking
    - Goal is to become competent enough that "any business would hire me as a VP of Marketing"
    - Encouraged Caleb to take the same approach with his promotion
    - "You can't just be a VP of marketing in one place. You got to be a VP of marketing period."

### StormForge Acquisition

- Official announcement scheduled for Monday (March 31, 2025)
- Caleb met with Josh (from StormForge) who has connections with AWS Brazil
    - This provides an entry point into South American market
    - Josh shared insights on StormForge ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
    - Minimum qualification spend for StormForge is around $20,000/month on Kubernetes
- William outlined integration timeline approach:
    1. Pre-launch preparation (current phase)
    2. First 30 days: integration, tying loose ends, learning gaps, maintaining business continuity
    3. Beyond 30 days: product roadmap integration, advancing field knowledge

### Market Analysis for StormForge

- William's assessment of Kubernetes optimization market:
    - Appears relatively small as a standalone product
    - StormForge has patent and strong technology but only 12 customers
    - StormForge targeted platform engineering teams while CloudBolt focuses on FinOps leaders
    - Early positive signals from MSP segment (potentially untapped market)
    - CloudBolt's stronger marketing engine can potentially accelerate pipeline growth
    - Positioned as a valuable add-on to existing offerings
- Training needs:
    - William will share IBM's Kubernetes primer course with Caleb and Joanne
    - Key discovery questions for customers:
        - How much is your business investing in Kubernetes?
        - What's your overall cloud composition of Kubernetes?
        - What types of Kubernetes services are you using?
        - Do you have optimization patterns for Kubernetes or is it over-provisioned?

### Marketing Performance Metrics

- Current quarter metrics:
    - 104 MQLs as of previous day (94% of budget)
    - 39-40 of 38 (metric unclear)
    - 60 cubed still
    - 26 converted to opportunities
    - 1.82 million pipeline
    - 6 dequeued
- Discussion about refining the definition of "dequeued" leads
    - Currently being used in two ways: initial junk leads and qualified leads deemed not a fit
    - William suggested potentially categorizing as "Junk DQ'd" vs "Not a fit DQ'd"
- Current opportunities:
    - Three intro calls this week
        - Nordcloud (looking at Aptio, Flexera) - CFM
        - Alchemy Group (working with Louisiana hospital system) - HCM
        - World Connect (billion-dollar company) - HCM
- Overall pipeline status:
    - 113 MQLs (94% of budget)
    - 70 SALs (62% of budget)
    - 30 SQLs (103% of budget)
    - 32 opportunities total with 2.8 million in pipeline (exceeding goal)
    - 82 open marketing-sourced opportunities totaling 10.8 million
    - Issue identified: $1.1 million in opportunities not touched in 15+ days

### Form Optimization for StormForge

- William proposed adding "Kubernetes optimization" as a separate option on demo submission forms
- Caleb agreed this would be beneficial to identify customer interests
