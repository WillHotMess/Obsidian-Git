## Summary

- Zero-dollar opportunity management

## Discussion Notes

### UIC Lead Analysis
- **Lead**: Professor Mark Grech from University of Chicago (UIC)
- **Concern**: Professor's role doesn't fit typical ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
- **Research findings**: Professor teaches cloud computing, has consulting business (Lone Star Consulting Inc.), conducts NSF-funded research
- **Key issue**: Missed opportunity to ask about cloud environment size and budget during demo call led by Steve

### Communication Style Concerns
- Caleb expressed confusion about Steve's communication style and expectations
- Steve's emails can be unclear and nuanced, requiring clarification
- Discussion about whether Steve is asking for opinions vs. directing actions

### Sales Process Analysis
- **Problem identified**: Inconsistent follow-up after demos
- Demo-to-close conversion issues, not intro-to-demo conversion
- AEs not consistently following up after demos, sometimes no follow-up for months
- Need for more proactive, persistent follow-up approach

### Lead Qualification Process
- Emphasized importance of researching prospects before calls
- Need to identify economic buyer, champion, and decision-maker roles early
- 15-minute introduction calls could help disposition unqualified leads faster

## Action Items
- [ ]  **William** to send follow-up email to Steve asking about total cloud environment size and which clouds UIC is using
- [ ]  **William** to explore potential academic partnership/pilot program with Product team (Ryan/Kyle)
- [ ]  **Caleb** to continue researching prospects before calls using tools like Gong
- [ ]  **Steve** to update zero-dollar opportunities by Tuesday (follow-up needed)
- [ ]  **Team** to discuss ABM campaign progress in Monday's meeting
- [ ]  **Caleb** to request full calendar visibility from AE team through Steve

## Follow-up
- **Next meeting date**: Monday (mentioned for ABM campaign discussion)
- **Additional resources**:
    - Gong recordings for lead research
    - Calendar access for AE team scheduling
    - Pipeline review of zero-dollar opportunities

## Key Decisions
1. UIC lead warrants further investigation and follow-up despite initial concerns
2. Will continue taking meetings with professors/academics but with better qualification
3. Focus on improving post-demo follow-up processes across the sales team
4. Need to address calendar availability and scheduling transparency with AE team

## Pipeline Status
- Multiple zero-dollar opportunities requiring updates
- Several active leads: Critical Cloud, ITZZ (small MSP), SoundCloud, BMO
- NordCloud deal still showing $0 in Salesforce, needs updating
- Positive trend in discovery call booking and follow-up rates

## Notable Concerns
- AE availability and calendar blocking practices
- Inconsistent opportunity value updates in Salesforce
- Need for better post-demo follow-up protocols
- Communication clarity with CRO regarding expectations
