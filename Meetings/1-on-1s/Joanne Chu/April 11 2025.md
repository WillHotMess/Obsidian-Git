The team discussed the current user journey, nurture paths, communication strategies, and top-of-funnel growth tactics. Key decisions included implementing automated emails through HubSpot, creating educational content for users at different stages, and identifying effective marketing channels to drive signups.

## Agenda
- Review current user journey and definitions
- Establish goals for product-led growth initiative
- Discuss nurture strategies for signups and installs
- Identify technical requirements and dependencies
- Brainstorm top-of-funnel growth tactics
- Define next steps and action items

## Discussion Notes
### Current User Journey & Definitions
- **Contact/Lead Clarification**: The team aligned on terminology, agreeing to consider signups that haven't installed as "contacts" and those who have installed as "leads"
- **Current Process**: When someone signs up, they receive an automated email from Pardot, but other trigger emails (Day 7, trial expiration) are not working properly
- **Technical Dependencies**: Segment needs to be connected to HubSpot to enable proper nurture paths and automation

### Trial Journey Phases

1. **Signup to Install**:
    - Most users either install immediately or never install
    - Current signup email often goes to junk folders
    - Need for follow-up emails 24-48 hours later
2. **First Week (Learning Mode)**:
    - Machine learning needs 7 days to collect representative data
    - All recommendations are in "learning mode" during this period
    - Users can learn UI/CLI and explore the product capabilities
3. **Post-7 Days (Deployment)**:
    - Users can start automatic application of recommendations
    - Best practice is to start with dev clusters before moving to non-prod
    - Most users begin with reliability risk recommendations over cost savings
4. **Trial Extension/Expiration**:
    - Users can extend once automatically for 15 days
    - Second extension requires talking to sales
    - Trial expiration should lead to pay-as-you-go option

### Nurture Strategy

- **Email Types and Timing**:
    - Signup confirmation (immediate)
    - Install follow-up (immediate after install)
    - Non-install follow-up (48 hours after signup if no install)
    - 7-day post-install email (when automation becomes available)
    - 30/45-day nurture emails for continued engagement
    - Trial expiration notification with options
- **Email Distribution**:
    - HubSpot for automated, no-reply emails and content delivery
    - Conversational emails from team members for personalized outreach
    - Need to be mindful of email volume to avoid overwhelming users

### Content Development

- **Video Walkthroughs**: Using StoryLane to create guided product demos
- **Documentation**: Linking to existing guides on configuration best practices
- **Educational Topics Needed**:
    - How to configure annotations
    - Using StormForge with Argo
    - Setting configuration maps
    - Best practices for recommendation deployment
    - Machine learning concepts in the product

### Top-of-Funnel Growth

- **Most Effective Channels to Date**:
    - Events (KCDs, KubeCon, workshops)
    - Technical content (articles, blogs)
    - AWS partnerships (containers on the couch)
    - Reddit discussions and community
- **Challenged Channels**:
    - Google Ads increased signups but mostly produced spam leads
- **New Opportunities**:
    - Leveraging $40,000 in MDF from AWS for pay-as-you-go promotion
    - Redirecting CloudBolt website traffic to StormForge free trial
    - Better targeting for different personas (FinOps vs. Kubernetes users)
