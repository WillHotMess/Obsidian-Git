## Meeting Details

- **Date & Time**: 2024-04-08 12:04:00
- **Location**: Virtual Meeting
- **Meeting Type**: Content Strategy Discussion

## Attendees

- William Norton (CloudBolt Software)
- J. Chu (jchu@cloudbolt.io)

## Summary
William and J. Chu discussed strategy for upcoming content creation, specifically focusing on a Ready-to-Run guide about Kubernetes optimization. They agreed to create content targeting FinOps leaders who need to understand Kubernetes architecture and cost implications following CloudBolt's acquisition of StormForge. They also brainstormed future content ideas about bridging the gap between engineering and FinOps teams, including a potential webinar series.

## Agenda
- Discuss direction for next Ready-to-Run guide
- Evaluate content focus (Kubernetes vs. broader approach)
- Consider content gating strategy
- Discuss additional content needs related to Broadcom/VMware

## Discussion Notes
- Initially debated between a narrow focus (Kubernetes containers) versus a broader approach
- Concern about alienating part of the audience with too narrow a focus was raised
- Discussed the FinOps Framework changes, including introduction of "scopes" beyond just cloud
- Reviewed engineering team challenges related to Kubernetes optimization
- William shared insights about organizational differences in various companies (Cisco model vs. Estee Lauder model)
- Agreed to focus primarily on Kubernetes for this guide to leverage StormForge acquisition momentum
- Outlined a potential structure for the Kubernetes guide:
    - Introduction to Kubernetes for FinOps leaders (100 level)
    - Kubernetes architecture and cost implications
    - Pain points and visibility challenges within clusters
    - Best practices for FinOps leaders (negotiated rates, hosting options, cluster configuration)
    - Recommendations for implementation
- Discussed content gating strategy, questioning current lead scoring approach
- Brainstormed future content idea: "Engineering vs. FinOps" webinar series
- Briefly discussed Broadcom/VMware campaign content needs

## Action Items
- [ ] J. Chu to create an outline for the Kubernetes Ready-to-Run guide
- [ ] William to help flesh out technical sections after initial outline is developed
- [ ] Potentially interview Yasmin for technical expertise on Kubernetes pain points
- [ ] Consider refreshing Broadcom alternative content to make it relevant for 2025
- [ ] J. Chu to contact Caleb regarding content needs for Broadcom/VMware campaign
- [ ] Discuss the "Engineering vs. FinOps" webinar series concept with the broader team

## Follow-up
- Next meeting: Not explicitly scheduled
- Additional resources: William mentioned potentially using Reddit to research beginner Kubernetes resources and McKinsey guide to digital transformation
