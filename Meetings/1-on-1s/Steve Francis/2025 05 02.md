## Agenda
- Quarter-to-date pipeline review
- Discussion of Callum's workload management
- Update on ABM campaign initiatives
- Messaging strategy and FOCUS framework integration
- Next steps for messaging collaboration

## Discussion Notes
- **Pipeline Status & Forecast**:
    - Current pipeline is trending well with opportunity count targets already achieved
    - There are several zero-dollar opportunities that need value updates
    - With forecasted ASP of ~$110K, pipeline value would be ~$2.2M
    - Nord Cloud opportunity (~$1M) not yet included in pipeline value
    - Adding Nord Cloud would bring pipeline to ~$3.1M, exceeding the target
- **Sales Team Workload**:
    - Callum has 31 opportunities (over 30% of all open opportunities)
    - 10 of Callum's opportunities are at $0 value, needing updates
    - Callum is handling SE work and generating significant pipeline while being relatively new to sales
    - Discussion of a situation where Callum missed completing a required customer questionnaire
    - Steve mentioned plans to have Callum offload some opportunities to Catherine
    - William offered support for administrative tasks like RFIs and questionnaires
- **ABM Campaigns**:
    - Caleb is creating targeted outreach campaigns with the field
    - Framework involves building targeted lists, outreach cadences, and setting up sales tools
    - Similar to the approach being used with Hitachi's MST play
    - Campaigns are designed as 21-day cadences targeting specific buyer groups/verticals
- **Messaging Strategy**:
    - Steve created a single-slide pitch but feels it needs refinement
    - Discussion about integrating the FOCUS framework into messaging
    - William explained the groundbreaking nature of FOCUS as creating one taxonomy across cloud providers
    - Both agreed CloudBolt's broad capabilities across hybrid cloud environments is a differentiator
    - William shared data showing cost optimization is a top priority across all personas (70%+ of submissions)
    - Steve noted current pitch is too inwardly focused on capabilities rather than customer problems
- **FOCUS Framework Discussion**:
    - William explained that FOCUS solves the problem of different cloud providers using distinct taxonomies
    - FOCUS creates a unified taxonomy making data transferable and adaptable
    - Without FOCUS, FinOps leaders must manually reconcile different billing formats
    - FOCUS enables connecting systems easily and extracting data for use throughout the organization
