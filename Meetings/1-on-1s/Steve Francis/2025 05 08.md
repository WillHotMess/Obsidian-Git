# Powerful Sales Positioning for CloudBolt's FOCUS-Driven Platform

Based on the valuable insights from GitLab's implementation of the FOCUS specification, here are creative sales pitches and positioning statements highlighting why CloudBolt's FOCUS-based approach delivers exceptional value:

## Core Value Propositions

### "Unified Cloud Intelligence, Delivered Faster"

CloudBolt transforms cloud cost analysis from quarterly reports to near real-time insights. Like GitLab discovered, engineers don't want to see data from a week ago - they want to see what's happening today. Our FOCUS-powered platform makes this possible across all your cloud environments.

### "From Data Wrangling to Business Impact"

With CloudBolt's FOCUS implementation, you'll spend less time aligning and normalizing data and more time actually doing FinOps. Stop wrestling with spreadsheets and start delivering value.

### "Multi-Cloud Simplicity Without the Complexity Tax"

Whether you're multi-cloud today or just one M&A away from it, CloudBolt's FOCUS-based platform positions your FinOps practice to seamlessly handle new areas of spend without adding layers of complexity.

## Target Audience-Specific Pitches

### For Engineering Leaders
Our FOCUS-powered platform gives engineers instant cost feedback through unit economics. Instead of needing to understand complex cloud architectures, they can work with simplified metrics like cost per request, cost per user, or cost per GB stored - making forecasting easier and more accurate. This transforms cost management from a finance-only exercise to an engineering-friendly practice.

### For Finance Teams
CloudBolt's implementation of FOCUS unifies terminology across cloud providers, enabling finance teams to self-serve cost insights. With our platform, you can run standardized queries that work across all your cloud environments, observing KPIs almost in real-time.

### For CIOs/CTOs
After implementing our FOCUS-based data model, you'll see spontaneous cost optimizations from engineering and product teams. As GitLab discovered, simply showing clear unit economic insights early drives teams to improve efficiency without top-down mandates.

## Differentiation Points

### "Trusted Data Drives Better Decisions"

One of the critical benefits of FOCUS is that it creates clarity which establishes trust in the data. It's no secret that trust in billing data has been a challenge for both practitioners and vendors due to data complexity. CloudBolt's FOCUS implementation brings the clarity that helps customers understand the true value of their cloud investments.

### "A Common Language Across Your Cloud Ecosystem"

The average organization uses 4.1 different FinOps tools. With CloudBolt's FOCUS-powered platform, these tools can finally speak the same language, eliminating the friction of different tools using different terminology. This common language extends from your raw data all the way to your executive dashboards.

### "Future-Proof Your FinOps Practice"
As cloud vendors continue to adopt the FOCUS specification, CloudBolt's early implementation means you're already aligned with where the industry is heading. FOCUS isn't just for public clouds - it works brilliantly for internal environments and private clouds where you're metering usage of shared resources. Our platform is ready to handle whatever cloud environments emerge next.

## ROI-Focused Messaging

### "80% Allocation Achievement"

GitLab achieved 80% cost mapping across all dimensions with their FOCUS implementation. CloudBolt can help you reach similar allocation levels, giving you unprecedented visibility into your cloud spending patterns.

### "5% Quarterly Savings"

Organizations implementing FOCUS-based FinOps like GitLab have achieved 5% savings on a quarterly basis simply through the increased visibility and unit economics insights. CloudBolt's platform makes these savings opportunities obvious and actionable.

### "From Forecast Guesswork to 1-2% Accuracy"

With FOCUS and unit economics, GitLab improved their forecasting accuracy to within 1-2% range for six-month horizons. CloudBolt's platform delivers this same forecasting precision through standardized metrics and clear unit costs.

## Call to Action

Don't wait for perfect cloud data - start your journey to better FinOps today. As the FinOps community emphasized, FOCUS 1.0 is the beginning of the conversation. The time is now for practitioners to turn on native data feeds and start working with cloud providers on what's working and what isn't. CloudBolt is ready to help you implement FOCUS and transform your cloud financial management.
