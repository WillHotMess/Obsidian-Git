## Meeting Details

- **Title**: FinOps Process Visualization and Presentation Strategy Discussion
- **Date & Time**: 2025-04-24 14:20
- **Location**: Virtual Meeting
- **Meeting Type**: Collaborative Working Session

## Attendees

- William Norton (Vice President of Marketing, CloudBolt Software)
- Ryan Wrenn

## Summary

William and Ryan collaborated on refining presentation slides about reimagining FinOps processes. The discussion focused on visual representations of FinOps workflows, emphasizing the contrast between traditional slow/inefficient approaches and optimized automated processes. They brainstormed ways to make the presentation more impactful by reducing complexity, adding concrete examples, and creating a coherent narrative around breaking existing paradigms with technology solutions like StormForge and CloudBolt.

## Agenda

- Review visualization concepts for FinOps process flows
- Refine presentation slides and narrative structure
- Discuss specific examples and use cases to illustrate key points
- Plan closing arguments connecting to business transformation and Green Ops

## Discussion Notes

- William presented a visualization of FinOps patterns showing "insight → evaluation → prioritization → action" flow
- Ryan provided feedback on making the visual representations more distinctive and impactful
- They discussed the problem of backlogs in FinOps where items get "trapped" in various stages
- The team explored renaming "anomaly" to "insights" or "waste signals" to better represent the concept
- They agreed the slides needed simplification - fewer bullet points and more concrete examples
- They developed a problem-solution framework for each stage of the process
- William and Ryan discussed leveraging StormForge as a concrete example for Kubernetes workloads
- They explored how to include other examples (Cloud Eagle for SaaS, native CloudBolt capabilities)
- The team discussed how to connect FinOps efficiency to sustainability/Green Ops goals

## Action Items

- [ ] William to simplify slides by reducing bullet points and focusing on one key point per stage
- [ ] Create visual highlighting for each stage of the process to better contextualize the content
- [ ] Develop concrete examples showing how StormForge breaks the paradigm for Kubernetes management
- [ ] Add additional examples for other resource types (IaaS, unused resources, SaaS)
- [ ] Create a closing slide showing business transformation outcomes and connection to Green Ops
- [ ] Coordinate with Charles to improve visualizations in Illustrator or Figma

## Follow-up

- Next meeting date: Not specified
- Additional resources: William mentioned having another slide deck that could be used to wrap up the presentation
