Craig/Mark,

I think the nucleus of this idea is spot-on - we absolutely need to expand our feedback channels from customers, prospects, partners, and the broader community. This directly connects to our ELT discussion last week about strengthening the feedback loop between product marketing, customer success, and development teams.

While Veeam's approach with their highly active forums represents one end of the spectrum, I believe we should pursue a middle ground that fits our context and resources. A technical Customer/Product Advisory Board would be valuable, supplemented by targeted engagement spaces like product forums or a Slack community.

I'm particularly interested in exploring a community platform for our CMP offering where customers could share blueprints and implementation patterns (similar to 6Sense's "RevCity" community) - this creates tangible value beyond just soliciting feedback.

My concern is our ability to sustain engagement. Our limited participation in the FinOps Foundation Slack community highlights the need for dedicated moderators and "rapid response" teams. We'd need to nominate specific people across departments who would commit to active participation.

Looking back, we didn't fully leverage our early access program for customer feedback. Before launching any new community initiative, we should define a clear value proposition and ensure we have the internal resources to maintain momentum.

Let me know your thoughts on next steps - I'd be happy to develop a more structured proposal if you're interested in pursuing this further.

Will
