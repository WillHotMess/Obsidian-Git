# Meeting Recap

## Meeting Details
- **Title**: FinOpsX Product Enablement Planning Meeting
- **Date & Time**: 2025-05-09 16:31
- **Location**: Virtual Meeting
- **Meeting Type**: Strategy/Planning

## Attendees
- William Norton (VP of Marketing, CloudBolt)
- Yasmin (Marketing)
- Referenced individuals (not present): Kyle, Nick Walker, Peter, Josh, Steve, Mark

## Summary
The meeting focused on planning CloudBolt's approach for the upcoming FinOpsX event, specifically around product enablement and messaging strategy. Yasmin volunteered to take over product enablement responsibilities from Kyle to free his time and as a "forcing function" for her to learn the product deeply. William shared the "continuous optimization" framework being developed for FinOpsX presentations and they discussed how to accurately present CloudBolt's capabilities without overpromising features that aren't fully implemented.

## Agenda
1. Product enablement planning for FinOpsX
2. Review of "continuous optimization" presentation
3. Feature validation and capabilities assessment
4. Competitive positioning discussion
5. Pre-event enablement planning

## Discussion Notes
- Yasmin has taken on product enablement to learn the platform better and free up Kyle's time for engineering work
- William emphasized the need for better communication about what features are truly available and their limitations
- "Continuous optimization" will be the central theme for FinOpsX presentations
- William shared Kyle's presentation focused on breaking out of common FinOps anti-patterns (report factory, reactive firefighters, policy police)
- The "insight to action" framework was discussed as a differentiator - focusing on automating the entire cycle from insight to evaluation to prioritization to action
- Significant discussion around competitive claims, particularly regarding VMware and public cloud integration capabilities
- Agreement that all feature claims should be verified with explicit understanding of limitations ("gotchas")
- Nick Walker has suggested a challenger sales approach: "You don't need another report. You don't need to shame your engineering teams. You don't need an army of people - you just need automation"

## Action Items
- [ ] Yasmin to create a document listing features that will be available by FinOpsX, including specific caveats and limitations
- [ ] William to develop the overarching presentation framework based on "continuous optimization" theme
- [ ] Schedule a pre-FinOpsX enablement call (as close to the event as possible) to review features and limitations
- [ ] Verify competitor capabilities for accurate competitive positioning
- [ ] Ensure demo capabilities for new features at FinOpsX

## Follow-up
- Next meeting: Pre-FinOpsX enablement call (timing TBD - as close to event as possible)
- Additional resources: Kyle's "continuous optimization" presentation, Nick Walker's challenger messaging
