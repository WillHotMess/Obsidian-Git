If CBSL Holdings is acquired by another company, several provisions come into play:  
  
1. **Potential Acceleration**: For options granted before June 24, 2019 (the "Restatement Date"), there is automatic accelerated vesting if your employment is terminated without Cause within 12 months following a Change in Control. This means 100% of your unvested options would immediately vest.

2. **For Newer Options**: For options granted after June 24, 2019, acceleration in a Change in Control is at the Committee's discretion.

3. **Alternative Handling**: During a Change in Control, the company may:
    - Cancel options and pay you the value (if any) based on the acquisition price
    - Arrange for the acquiring company to assume or substitute your options
    - Replace your options with a cash incentive program

The definition of "Change in Control" includes scenarios like:  
- Direct sale of all or substantially all company assets
- Acquisition of 50% or more of company stock
- Board member replacement
- Liquidation/dissolution
- Certain mergers and reorganizations
