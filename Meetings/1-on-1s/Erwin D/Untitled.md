# Meeting Details

- **Title**: CloudBolt AWS Marketplace Strategy & PLG Approach Discussion
- **Date & Time**: 2025-05-02 11:28-12:01
- **Location**: Virtual Meeting
- **Meeting Type**: Strategic Alignment

## Attendees
- William Norton (VP of Marketing, CloudBolt)
- Erwin Daria (AWS Partnership Manager)

## Summary
The meeting focused on aligning CloudBolt's marketing strategy with AWS Marketplace initiatives, particularly around PLG (Product-Led Growth) approaches. Key topics included integration of AWS Marketplace links into nurture campaigns, tracking marketplace visits to reach the 100-unique-visitor threshold required for AWS analytics portal access, and strategies for promoting the AWS marketplace listing through upcoming events like KCD Austin. The discussion also covered improving the documentation of customer wins through a standardized "win wire" process that would benefit both AWS reporting and internal knowledge sharing.

## Agenda
- Current status of AWS Marketplace PLG strategy
- Integration of AWS tracking links into marketing campaigns
- Learn Kubernetes campaign budget allocation
- "Win wire" documentation process for customer success stories
- KCD Austin event planning for AWS marketplace promotion

## Discussion Notes
- **PLG Strategy & AWS Marketplace Integration**
    - Current approach is to include AWS marketplace as an exit path in nurture campaigns, particularly in later stages (day 21/28)
    - AWS requires 100 unique visitors to the marketplace listing before providing analytics portal access
    - Erwin has access to AWS tracking links that need to be integrated into marketing materials
    - William suggested a measured approach of introducing AWS purchase options later in the nurture journey after focusing on sales engagement
- **Product UX & AWS Integration**
    - Discussion about implementing "Buy with AWS" functionality directly in the product
    - Current registration flow challenges: disconnect between standard signup and AWS customer path
    - Suggestion to implement "Sign in with AWS" similar to existing Google/GitHub options
    - Agreement that in-product purchase paths have higher conversion rates
- **Learn Kubernetes Campaign**
    - $30,000 budget allocated for Learn Kubernetes
    - Mark previously mentioned reaching out to Learn Kubernetes to develop a custom campaign
    - Unclear ownership of next steps with Learn Kubernetes team
    - William offered to follow up with Mark about responsibility assignment
- **KCD Austin Event Strategy**
    - Plan to create QR codes linked to AWS marketplace tracking URLs
    - Leverage existing EKS Automode content to create print assets for event
    - Will use event to drive traffic to AWS marketplace, contributing to 100-visitor threshold
    - William suggested retrofitting existing content into print-ready format
- **Win Wire Documentation Process**
    - Erwin sought input on involvement with AWS win wires (customer success documentation)
    - William proposed expanding beyond AWS-only documentation to benefit entire organization
    - Suggestion for standardized 30-minute calls after wins, involving key stakeholders (Joanne, Erwin, Nick Mack, Will)
    - Agreement to introduce this process suggestion at next ELT meeting
    - Current Custom Ink win wire in progress, but future wins will follow new process
