## Discussion Notes
- Both participants acknowledged challenges with current back-to-back meeting schedules, partly attributed to integration between CloudBolt and StormForge teams and recent changes including a new CEO
- Nick shared insights from his SCO meeting attendance, where he met with sales and CSM teams in person
- William noted that Nick's name has come up frequently in discussions about improving product information flow
- Current challenges with product communication identified:
    - Lack of clear communication flow from product development to marketing
    - CSMs often don't know when new features are coming or how to use them
    - William currently handling 70% of marketing operations despite product marketing being his primary role
- Nick is moving into a more defined product management role focusing initially on the new platform
- Discussion of using existing JIRA Ideas board as a foundation for more structured product information tracking
- William proposed creating a "marketability index" (scale 0-4) for features to indicate communication needs:
    - 0: Bug fixes (no marketing needed)
    - 1: Solution Engineers need to know (potential workflow impacts)
    - 2: Sales team enablement needed
    - 3: External marketing needed
    - 4: Full product launch
- Nick noted his initial focus will be on the new platform, not CSMP and HCM products
- William emphasized the need for a consistent process across all products
- Discussed automation possibilities for feature announcements via Slack when items are completed in JIRA
- Nick suggested rethinking how they use the JIRA Ideas board, as his approach separates broader ideas from deliverable epics
- Reviewed Siften social listening tool:
    - Currently tracking StormForge competitors and related keywords
    - Tool allows setting up to 20 filters on the current plan ($40/month)
    - Nick has added CloudBolt as a monitored term
    - Most useful content comes from Reddit discussions
    - Tool tests showed potential for competitor monitoring (CloudZero was demoed)
- Reviewed Argo CD documentation content that William had drafted
    - Nick suggested simplifying the language about field managers
    - Nick explained that Argo CD enables GitOps workflows for Kubernetes clusters
    - Discussed how Argo CD helps maintain desired state management (prevents drift)
    - Compared to Flux (alternative GitOps tool)
- Discussed follow-up needed for Java content review
    - Content is awaiting Nick's review before publishing on StormForge website
    - Discussed preferred formats for collaboration (Markdown, Confluence)

- [ ] Nick to continue refining the product development workflow to better integrate with marketing needs
- [ ] William to establish a recurring meeting series with Nick to maintain alignment

Hi Steve and Cloudbolt team, Steve applied for FinOps X without a Sponsor Code. Cloudbolt can buy as many additional passes as they want for SME roles but not for sale/marketing roles. For this reason we ask sponsors to use their Sponsor passes for sales /marketing roles. However, it looks like Cloudbolt have used some Sponsor Codes for SME roles (e.g Ryan Wrenn), rather than the overhead of making you swap let's just assume that's what you did and I'll ask our team to accept Steve's paid registration in lieu of one your sponsor passes.
