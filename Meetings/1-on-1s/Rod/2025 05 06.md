## Discussion Notes

### Company Context and Leadership
- Rod has recently taken on a leadership role at CloudBolt, coming from StormForge
- William noted the company has gone through many iterations over his three years, which "feels like nine"
- Both acknowledged the importance of fresh perspective and new leadership to move the company forward

### Product Positioning and Market Approach
- William presented a Venn diagram showing CloudBolt's capabilities across three areas:
    - Cloud Management
    - Cloud Resource Optimization
    - FinOps
- CloudBolt has placed well in all three Gigaom analyst reports but hasn't fully integrated these capabilities
- William believes better integration of these three areas is key to market success
- Discussion around ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) analysis showed that regardless of role or lifecycle stage, customers have consistent needs:
    - Financial focus (over 75% of leads express interest)
    - Orchestration and automation
    - Governance

### Product Capabilities Discussion
- Detailed discussion of CloudBolt's CSMP (Cloud Vault Platform) cost visibility capabilities:
    - Can show Kubernetes cluster costs
    - Has tenant-based views that can separate by application
    - Can filter by resource types, project codes, etc.
- Current limitation: CMP and cost platforms are largely separate with minimal integration
- Rod and William discussed the challenge of demonstrating a truly integrated end-to-end solution

### Integration Opportunity

- William proposed a valuable use case that doesn't yet exist:
    - When provisioning new resources in CMP, insights from cost data could suggest better sizing options
    - Example: "Your organization has 30 similar instances and they're typically over-provisioned by 40%"
    - This would allow proactive optimization rather than reactive fixes
- Both agreed this "closed loop" integration between products would be valuable but isn't currently implemented

### Sales Challenges

- Identified issues with sales execution:
    - High turnover in sales leadership and sales representatives
    - Long ramp-up time (3-6 months) for new sellers to understand products
    - Lack of established, repeatable sales motions
    - Insufficient onboarding process
    - Need for more tenacity in pursuing opportunities

### Go-to-Market Diversification

- William advocated for diversifying go-to-market approaches beyond large deal focus:
    - Product-led growth (PLG)
    - Marketplace presence
    - Creating "steady state" revenue streams to complement large deals
- William noted these approaches have "fallen on deaf ears" previously but sees StormForge integration as an opportunity

### Defensible & Sellable Use Cases

- Rod and William identified current defensible use cases:
    - BillOps (specific subset of CSMP)
    - StormForge
    - CMP (Cloud Management Platform)
- Aria Automation replacement was discussed as opportunistic but challenging:
    - Requires customer migration from vCenter (a major undertaking)
    - Would need better support for alternative hypervisors

### Sales Enablement

- Rod proposed creating 2-3 minute "world class" videos to support less experienced sales reps
- Discussed need for greater expertise and "verbal readiness" in the sales organization
- William agreed and emphasized the need for clear "big bets" with defined focus areas
- Both acknowledged the challenge of balancing the future vision with current revenue needs
