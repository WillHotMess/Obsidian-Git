## Topics

**Partner Deal Registration Process**
- Nick introduced a new deal registration form that creates leads directly in CloudBolt's system
- The form contains the same fields as the previous partner portal form and includes Kubernetes use cases (without referencing StormForge)
- A paragraph was added to reassure partners that their customer information won't be misused
- This is an interim solution until a proper PRM system is implemented
- Only two partners (F3 and Presidio) were actively using the old portal

**Financial Integration**

- Sandy needs to set up StormForge invoicing ASAP for consolidation purposes
    - StormForge currently uses QuickBooks for invoicing, which will eventually be phased out
    - No StormForge renewals are expected in April
    - No month-to-month contracts
- Sandy is creating Airbase credit cards for monthly StormForge expenses to facilitate transitio

**Contract Management**
- Nick is working to obtain StormForge commercial contracts from Lucia to port into Salesforce
- Contracts will likely start in Salesforce as of 3/31 with actual renewal dates
- Contract assignment rights for existing StormForge customers require attention, as Lucia indicated they may not have explicit assignment rights in agreements
    
**Customer Management & Support**
- Uncertainty exists about who will manage StormForge customer relationships post-acquisition
- Frank suggests bringing StormForge customers into CloudBolt's CS practice, potentially with one dedicated CSM for all StormForge business
- StormForge currently uses Slack channels and email for support
- The team needs to determine support transition plans and whether any StormForge support staff will join CloudBolt
    

**Sales Reporting**
- Discussion about a potential large deal (Readapt) that could grow StormForge's business by 40%
- Questions about how deals will be reported between the companies during transition
- Plan to create a consolidated sales approach with Brendan and Nick
    

## Key Decisions
1. The new partner deal registration form will replace the previous partner portal functionality
2. StormForge financial records must be integrated into CloudBolt systems within 30 days of acquisition close
3. Sandy will set up credit cards in Airbase for ongoing StormForge monthly expenses
4. Even deals on StormForge's books pre-acquisition will be considered wins for the combined entity from a strategic perspective
