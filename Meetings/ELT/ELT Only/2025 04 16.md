## Discussion Notes
### StormForge Marketing & Free Trial Concerns
- Currently nurturing leads post-KubeCon event with personalized outreach
- Building HubSpot nurture sequences for free trial signups to improve conversion
- Significant concerns raised about StormForge's free trial model:
    - Multiple users from same organization creating separate tenants
    - Ryan observed different email addresses from the same organization getting assigned to different tenants
    - Potential for exploitation (getting value without converting to paid)
    - Example scenario: Development teams could use free trial for initial optimization, lock in values, and not subscribe
    - Misalignment on prioritizing Amazon PAYGO as commercialization path
    - Team agrees to gather data on potential abuse patterns to present to leadership
    - Current trial periods: 30 days by default, PAYGO offers 45-day trial

### CRM Migration Status
- Account migration completed successfully last night
- Contacts migration in progress (being done in batches throughout the day)
- Opportunities and customer contracts to be completed by noon tomorrow
- Historic opportunities will migrate Friday through weekend
- Error rate below 1% and decreasing
- Segment integration being rerouted through HubSpot to support nurture sequences
- Nick to provide follow-up readout detailing all changes

### Financial & Commercial Concerns
- StormForge using 90-day guarantee ("it'll work or else") resulting in 3+9 month contracts
- Sandy noted StormForge's poor financial performance ("financials suck")
- Potential issues with renewal revenue as StormForge's value proposition reduces core count
    - Example: If successful at reducing core count, customers may renew at lower amounts
    - Sandy suggested this is similar to FinOps tools but not seeing the same issue there
    - Frank to discuss with Yasmin
- Back-office integration largely complete; approvals now routing through Airbase
- Nick caught and corrected issues with the Custom Ink contract that would have cost $40,000
- Per vCPU SKU for StormForge now added to price book

### Support Package Integration
- Team discussing how to integrate StormForge into support packages
- Need to align on support tiers across all products
- Augie to work with Sean and Colin on alignment
- Changes to support packages will trigger updates to the price book

### Pipeline Reporting & Lead Quality
- Frank noted there's $925K in cross-sell pipeline showing in reports
- Challenges with tracking StormForge pipeline/leads due to:
    - Integration still in progress
    - Free trial signups not considered qualified leads (often Gmail addresses)
    - Lack of clear conversion path
- Need for manual compilation of data until integration is complete
- Real target is 60 opportunities, $4M pipeline, $900K revenue
- Confusion between leads vs opportunities at executive level

### HCM Webinar Series
- Frank proposing to delay by one week due to travel schedules
- Originally targeting April 30th to start
- Will showcase product updates and roadmap
- Targeting separate sessions for Americas, EMEA, and APAC
- Identified new integration possibilities during Bethesda session

### Product Updates Communication
- William presented new automated system using Jira → Airtable → Slack for consistent updates
- Will provide regular (biweekly) updates on product changes
- Need to adapt frequency for HCM updates which may need different cadence (monthly/quarterly)
- System will help create transparency around product changes
- Ryan highlighted need for product team accountability in maintaining idea descriptions

### Team Offsite Discussion
- Team considering in-person meeting
- Suggestion to meet before Nick goes on parental leave
- William to connect with team individually to develop agenda
- Focus on cross-functional alignment topics

## Action Items
- [ ] Nick to complete migration of StormForge data into Cloudbolt systems by end of week
- [ ] William & Nick to align on lead qualification criteria for StormForge free trials
- [ ] Team to gather data on potential free trial abuse (multiple tenants, cluster usage) to present to leadership
