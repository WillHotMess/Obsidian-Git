## Summary
This meeting focused on evaluating Q1 marketing performance metrics, analyzing the sales pipeline, and addressing critical issues with opportunity management and follow-up processes. The team identified significant challenges with sales execution, particularly around pipeline management and follow-up activities.

## Pipeline Highlights
In the second week of Q2, we have generated **12 MQLs** (10% to budget), **2 SALs** (2% to budget), **1 SQL** (3% to budget), and **3 New Opportunities** (14% to budget), with **$450,000 new pipeline** created this quarter.

Current pipeline status:
- 84 Total Open Opportunities
- $7.8M in outstanding Pipeline value
- The average age for open opportunities is approximately 185 days (about 6 months)
- **64.3% of opportunities (54)** are older than 90 days, representing $5.72M in pipeline value

Our focus remains on both progressing older opportunities and cleaning up our pipeline.

### Deals progressing well:
- **Bynet Data Communications ($350K)**: Recent demo completed (April 7) with good fit identified for 10,000+ VM environment. Deep dive demo scheduled for April 25.
- **Getronics - CMP ($164K)**: MSP and PSA agreements have internal approval. Final paperwork and order form in process with anticipated close by mid-April.
- **Sycomp - FinOps ($150K)**: Deep dive completed March 17. Seeing good value in CB for BillOps and FinOps, though likely Q3/Q4 close due to existing contract.

### Opportunities requiring intervention:
- **Frontier Airlines ($250K)**: 71 days inactive. Last activity was FinOps demo on January 28, with no follow-up for the needed HCM demo.
- **HCA Healthcare ($700K)**: 74 days inactive. Working with Deloitte on pricing, but no recent engagement logged in CRM.
- **TELUS Corporation ($300K)**: 243 days inactive. Last meeting was August 9, 2024. Need to validate if this is still an active opportunity.
- **Dell Technologies - Future Fusion ($400K)**: Contact reported internal reorganization on March 14, with progress slowed. Regular check-ins needed.

## Key Recommendations
1. **Immediate Intervention Required:** Schedule engagement meetings for Frontier Airlines, HCA Healthcare, and TELUS Corporation to validate status and prevent potential loss of $1.25M in pipeline.
2. **Process Improvement Needed:** Implement a consistent activity logging policy across the team, as 67% of opportunities show recent activity in Next Steps comments but not in CRM activity dates.
3. **Pipeline Cleanup:** Review and update the 54 opportunities older than 90 days, which represent $5.72M in pipeline value. Consider implementing a 180-day age threshold for mandatory review.
4. **Close Date Realism:** Many opportunities show unrealistic close dates relative to their stage and activity level. Update these to improve forecast accuracy, particularly for deals with critical inactivity.
