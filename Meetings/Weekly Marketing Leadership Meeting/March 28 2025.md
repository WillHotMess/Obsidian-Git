### Voice of Customer Analysis

### Product Strategy Alignment

- Discussion about differing perceptions of CMP performance in the market:
    - Senior leadership claims CMP pipeline is drying up due to messaging/roadmap issues
    - William presented conflicting data showing HCM represents approximately 50% of inbound demos
    - Marketing is exceeding pipeline targets (150% for quarter) with 44% from HCM
- Concerns about "confirmation bias" among sales leadership
- Tensions regarding product strategy:
    - Push for separate roadmaps vs. Kyle's "one cloud, one roadmap, one strategy" approach
    - Mark: "We can't have these factions using confirmation bias to justify going their own way"
- Need for executive alignment at C-suite level (Sean, Steve, Kyle)

- Social media posts scheduled for 10:00 AM

### Budget and Media Coverage

    - Team debating value vs. cost (standard Forbes advertorial costs $10,000)
    - Agreement to delay decision until after announcement
- Ad budget considerations:
    - Current StormForge ad budget around $3,000
    - Questions about long-term investment in StormForge-specific advertising
    - Concerns about ROI for platform engineering audience vs. FinOps leaders
