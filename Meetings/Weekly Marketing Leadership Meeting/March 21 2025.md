# Summary of Will's Concerns About Free Trial Experience

## Main Concerns

Here are my concerns with the current guided demo experience that's replacing the free trial button:

1. **Inconsistent User Experience**: The experience is confusing and is disorienting; especially compared to any other SaaS company. (This is harmful to our brand as a company and as marketers.) 
2. **Buyer Confusion**: Different buyer personas are getting a misaligned experience:
    - Users expecting a product trial are instead getting a guided demo of only FinOps functionality.
    - CMP buyers click "free trial" but see a FinOps product demo
    - FinOps buyers may not see what they're looking for in the limited demo
	    - MSPs likely experience this issue as well. 
    - Current customers may be confused by the inconsistency of product lineup
3. **Lead Generation Impact**: Potentially losing prospects due to the confusing experience and bait-and-switch perception (clicking "free trial" but getting a guided demo).
4. **Future Complications**: The upcoming StormForge integration will further complicate matters since they have an actual functioning free trial.

## Recommendations for Next Week

1. Meet with Craig after collecting one week of data to review metrics and user behavior.
2. Present a clear recommendation to **pause the free trial button** and revert to "Book a Demo" until a proper solution is developed.
3. Propose developing more interactive tours for all product lines (CMP, MSP, FinOps, StormForge) that are clearly labeled as product tours, not trials.
4. Address the need for a cohesive product experience strategy before the StormForge integration creates additional confusion.
5. Consider a "choose your path" approach if real free trials are important, allowing users to select which product they're interested in rather than defaulting to one experience.
