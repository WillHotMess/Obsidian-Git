- Discuss HCM campaign performance issues
- Plan for upcoming FinOps X event
- Allocate marketing resources for upcoming initiatives

## Discussion Notes

### StormForge Campaign Review

- Current campaign data shows clean metrics from April 28th to May 26th
- Overall performance is "fine" but not as strong as other CloudBolt campaigns
- Search impression share is very low (under 10% for top of funnel, 15-20% for others)
- The campaign is trying to cover too much ground with the current budget (~$90/day)
- Cost per click is reasonable ($1.51-$8) compared to other campaigns

### Keyword Analysis
- Top of Funnel (TOFU) keywords are too generic and focused on Kubernetes features
    - Examples: "Kubernetes Resource Management," "Automate Kubernetes," "Kubernetes Autoscaling"
    - These terms are generating impressions but have poor relevance and conversion
- Middle of Funnel (MOFU) keywords are performing better with good click-through rates
- Bottom of Funnel (BOFU) keywords include competitor terms and are getting good impressions

### New Strategy Development
- Decision to redirect budget from generic TOFU keywords to more targeted campaigns
- New focus on AWS partnership opportunities:
    - EKS Auto Mode and Karpenter as primary keywords
    - Leveraging AWS partner credits to offset costs
    - Creating "Better Together" messaging for the StormForge/AWS integration
    - Utilizing existing solution brief for ad copy development
- Search volumes for EKS Auto Mode keywords look promising (1,000-3,000 monthly searches)

### HCM Campaign Analysis
- The HCM campaign is underperforming with no conversions despite $7,000 spent
- Issues identified:
    - High cost-per-click ($18 average)
    - Low click-through rates (2.7% vs. higher rates in other campaigns)
    - Potential mismatch between keywords, ad copy, and landing pages
    - Keywords like "cloud management platform" are expensive and competitive
- Decision to pause the HCM campaign (~$100/day) pending website and strategy revisions
- Plan to revisit on June 16th with Mark to realign the HCM strategy

### FinOps X Event Planning
- Event attendance: William, Mark, Joanne, and Charles (next week)
- Need to cancel all next week's meetings
- William will organize a Tuesday afternoon call to share insights from Day 1
- Planning for real-time LinkedIn post boosting during the event
- Opportunity to leverage PR team for maximum visibility

### General Marketing Insights
- Traffic quality has dramatically improved despite lower volume
- Time on page has increased from 1.5 minutes to approximately 20 minutes year-over-year
- De-emphasizing irrelevant technical content that was previously driving traffic
- CloudBolt is showing up well in AI search results (Claude, Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini)
- Focus on diversified content distribution channels (newsletters, LinkedIn, Reddit)
