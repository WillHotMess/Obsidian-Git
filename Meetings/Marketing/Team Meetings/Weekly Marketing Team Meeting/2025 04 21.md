## Key Recommendations

1. **Immediate actions needed**:
    
    - Complete and submit Gijima RFI by April 22 deadline
    - Re-engage AT&T team to revive POC momentum
    - Schedule follow-up calls for stale Qualification opportunities (67% inactive)
2. **Process improvements needed**:
    
    - Implement weekly check-ins for all POCs to prevent expiration issues
    - Develop a clear strategy for opportunities blocked by FedRAMP requirements
    - Update CRM activity dates more consistently, particularly in the Qualification stage
3. **Forecasting adjustments**:
    
    - Current pipeline suggests we'll reach approximately 75% of Q2 pipeline target
    - Focus on converting existing late-stage opportunities to offset early-quarter gap
    - Accelerate marketing activities to boost MQL generation, which is tracking at 23% of target
