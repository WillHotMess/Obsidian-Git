## Summary
The marketing leadership team discussed challenges with prioritizing StormForge integration following the recent acquisition. Key concerns included resource allocation, competing priorities, lack of clear executive expectations, and the need to establish boundaries for new demands. The team explored potential value propositions for StormForge's Kubernetes optimization capabilities while considering how to maintain focus on core CloudBolt marketing initiatives.

## Agenda
- StormForge integration priorities and resource allocation
- Go-to-market strategy alignment for StormForge
- Marketing workflow management and outsourcing possibilities
- StormForge value proposition evaluation
- Next steps for stakeholder alignment

## Discussion Notes
- **Resource Allocation Concerns**:
    - Marketing team acquired two new product lines without additional headcount
    - Competing priorities between existing CloudBolt marketing and StormForge initiatives
    - Need to realign expectations with leadership on what's realistically achievable
- **StormForge Integration Strategy**:
    - Current approach feels ad-hoc with unclear ownership and expectations
    - Maintaining separate go-to-market strategy for StormForge until full integration
    - Team debating between maintaining current StormForge marketing motions versus integrating into CloudBolt's approach
    - Need to establish clear boundaries on what marketing will support
- **Value Proposition Assessment**:
    - StormForge offers point solution for Kubernetes optimization
    - Current value to FinOps is as "nice to have" rather than essential capability
    - More valuable for HCM buyers who have authority to mandate usage
    - Team sees opportunity to leverage CloudBolt's broader audience reach
    - Questioning if current enthusiasm matches realistic market potential
- **Marketing Operations**:
    - Discussion about potential partnership with agency "2x" for overflow support
    - Consideration of outsourcing tactical work to free up strategic capacity
    - Concerns about onboarding new vendors creating additional management overhead
    - Need for alignment with Yasmin on transitioning StormForge marketing
- **Cross-Organizational Friction**:
    - Cultural differences between StormForge's small team approach and CloudBolt's structure
    - Need to establish clear communications and decision-making protocols
    - Concerns about requests circumventing proper channels
