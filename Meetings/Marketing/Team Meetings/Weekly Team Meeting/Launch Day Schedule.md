I've reviewed the meeting transcript regarding the CloudBolt acquisition of StormForge planned for Tuesday, March 31st. Here's a summary of the key launch plans and coordination points:

## Launch Day Schedule (March 31st)

- **9:00 AM ET**: Press release goes live on the wire
- **Launch Sequence**:
    1. Press release published on CloudBolt and StormForge websites
    2. Customer communications sent (prioritized before social)
    3. Marketing communications to broader audiences
    4. Social media announcements on LinkedIn and other platforms
    5. Follow-up social posts featuring the Craig and John video

## Key Assets Being Prepared
- Press release for the wire and websites
- Customer and marketing emails (different versions for different audiences)
- Landing page with multiple resources (video, blog, PR, etc.)
- Solution guide/integration guide
- Website updates (banners, ribbons, etc.) for both companies
- Social media graphics and copy
- Video featuring Craig and John discussing the acquisition

## Advertising Plans
- New K8 Cost Optimization campaigns on Google Ads and 6Sense
- Refreshed brand ads on Google
- Updates to StormForge's existing channels (Reddit, Google Ads)

## Team Coordination

- A dry run is planned for Friday before launch
- Joanne will coordinate with Cass on the marketing list audience selections
- Charles is handling website updates and the video production
- Mark is working with Yasmin on messaging and coordination
- Will has created the solution guide and is handling SEO keywords

The team is ensuring proper sequencing of assets so nothing goes live with broken links, and they're planning to have all the major work completed this week to allow for buffer time in case of issues.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the launch plan?
