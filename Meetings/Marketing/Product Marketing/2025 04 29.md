## Discussion Notes
### New Product Updates Process
- William has created an automated system in Airtable that syncs with JIRA to pull in completed product tickets
- The system uses AI to summarize new features into marketing-friendly language
- Updates are automatically sent to the #product-announcements Slack channel every Friday
- Goal is to expand this to include all product lines (HCMI, Storm Forge)
- Benefits: Keeps CSMs, SE team, and field staff informed of new features
- Discussion about improving the process by:
    - Having more product-defined categories rather than AI-defined ones
    - Including links to the actual tickets
    - Ensuring closed items include detailed descriptions of delivered functionality

### Recent Product Releases
- OCI support for cost reports was released
    - Currently released in DXC tenant and sales tenant
    - Supports cost reporting in OCI but not optimization yet
    - Discussion about when to publicly announce this feature
    - Need to ensure it's available to all customers before announcement

### Product-Marketing Communication Process
- Discussion about improving communication channels for product updates
    - Agreement to use CB-Product Slack channel for new feature discussions
    - William to set up regular one-on-ones with Nick (Product)
    - Need for clearer process on what's being released and what should be marketed

### FinOps X Preparation (T-30)
- Key features expected to be ready:
    - Cost dashboard across AWS, Azure, OCI, and GCP
    - Early BillOps capabilities for MSP persona
    - Storm Forge integration improvements (more integrated UI)
    - Some Cloud Eagle mockups
    - Potentially some new AI capabilities (anomalies or chatbot)
- Features discussed but unlikely to be ready:
