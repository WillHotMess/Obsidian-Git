## Discussion Notes

### 1. New Product Update Process
- William presented a new automated workflow using Air Table to track and communicate product updates:
    - System pulls from JIRA board to track new features/functionality
    - AI logic creates summaries in marketing-friendly language
    - Automation sends updates to Slack channel (#product-announcements) bi-weekly
    - Goal is to expand this process to all products (HCM, Storm Forge)
    - Plan to create monthly customer communications from these updates
- Integration Discussion:
    - Ryan suggested working with Nick as point of contact for improving inputs
    - William wants product-defined categories rather than AI-defined ones
    - Need to ensure descriptions capture reality of delivered features vs. initial ideas

### 2. Recent Product Releases - OCI Support
- OCI support for cost reports was recently released
    - Currently in sales tenant and DXC tenant
    - Supports cost reporting but not optimization yet
    - Optimization for OCI is not currently on the roadmap
    - Would require significant investment to support OCI APIs for native integration
- Communication Challenges:
    - Marketing team wasn't aware of the OCI release timing
    - Discussion about improving cross-team communication through Slack
    - Need to clarify deployment status before public announcement (feature flags, general availability)

### 3. FinOPS X Planning (T-30 Days)
- Ryan shared key features expected for FinOPS X showcase:
    - Cost dashboard across AWS, Azure, OCI, and GCP
    - Early BillOPS capabilities for MSP persona
    - Storm Forge integration improvements (moving from partners section to integrated metrics)
    - Potential Cloud Eagle mock-ups
    - Possible AI capabilities (anomalies detection or chatbot)
- Feature Status:
    - Dashboard with new KPIs and widgets will be ready
    - Sankey diagrams likely won't be ready for FinOPS X
    - Agent/Chatbot features are more likely to be available than Sankey diagrams
    - Storm Forge integration will be demonstrable
- Marketing Approach:
    - William emphasized need for differentiated features for demos
    - Preference for integrated flow rather than switching between products
    - Will need mid-month check-in to finalize demo approach
    - Need to balance what to talk about vs. what to show vs. what to preview

### 4. Product-Marketing Communication Process
- Discussion about how to improve communication:
    - Will add Nick and product team to recurring meetings
    - William to set up regular 1:1 with Nick
    - Will use CB-Product Slack channel for product updates and discussions
    - Team agreed that more proactive communication in Slack would benefit everyone
