## Discussion Notes

### Dashboard Development Progress
Kassandra presented significant updates to the HubSpot dashboard, including new funnel reporting capabilities that track the complete customer journey from sign-up through conversion. The team discussed the technical challenges of creating comprehensive funnel reports in HubSpot, with William noting historical difficulties with similar reporting across various platforms.

### Data Management and Filtering
The conversation revealed ongoing challenges with data accuracy, particularly around filtering out internal and known contacts. The team identified several domain patterns (PickPay variations, CustomInk, Equifax, HSBC) that need systematic filtering. Nick emphasized the need for both automated and manual processes to tag "known" contacts to improve data quality.

### Technical Implementation Challenges
Kassandra explained the limitations of HubSpot's custom property usage in reporting, requiring creative workarounds to achieve the desired funnel visualization. The team discussed the complexity of tracking various customer engagement paths and the need to tie activities back to lifecycle stages for optimal reporting.

### Conference and Staffing Coordination
William and Joanne will be attending FinOps conference next week, providing an opportunity for the team to focus on sales and marketing operations work. Nick's upcoming parental leave (starting June 13) was discussed, with emphasis on completing critical tasks and data imports before his departure.

### HubSpot Pricing Model Changes
A significant portion of the discussion centered on HubSpot's transition to a seat-based pricing model. The team needs to review current user access, assign appropriate seat types (Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Core), and optimize costs by removing unnecessary users and utilizing partner seats where applicable.
