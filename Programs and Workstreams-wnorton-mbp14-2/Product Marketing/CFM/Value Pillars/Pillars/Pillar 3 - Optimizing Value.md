> _**Goal:** I need to scale my FinOps programs impact through the use of automation as manual optimization becomes unsustainable against growing multi-cloud complexity_

> **Elevator:** CloudBolt transforms cloud optimization into a seamless, automated process, empowering organizations to scale FinOps impact across multi-cloud environments. With our Cloud Native Actions platform, we reduce insight-to-action lead time from months to minutes by automating resource optimization and integrating workflows directly into engineering processes. By codifying optimization policies, CloudBolt can save organizations hundreds of thousands of dollars compared to traditional manual processes.

**Market Forces:** Economic pressures demand organizations maximize ROI on every cloud dollar, but growing multi-cloud complexity makes manual optimization unsustainable.

**Business Evolution:** Cloud financial decision-making has shifted to distributed ownership, requiring new approaches to governance and optimization.

**Hurdles:** Siloed tools hinder cross-functional collaboration, leaving teams unable to scale optimization efforts in dynamic cloud environments.

**Risk Exposure:** Manual processes create inefficiencies, backlogs, and operational disruptions, undermining business continuity and ROI.

**Value Proposition:** CloudBolt transforms cloud optimization with automated workflows that integrate seamlessly with engineering processes, closing the insight-to-action gap and maximizing cloud ROI.

**Proof Points:** Reduced “Insight-to-Action” lead time by 99%, Codify Day-2 Optimization Policies

**Innovation Engines:** Cloud Native Actions

## Market Problem:

Economic pressures have intensified the focus on efficiency and ROI, pushing organizations to extract maximum value from every investment.

## Business Evolution:

Financial decision-making has shifted from centralized control to distributed ownership, with individual teams directly influencing cloud economics. This democratization demands new approaches to optimization and governance.

## Hurdles & Challenges:

Today's distributed cloud ownership demands cross-functional collaboration, but current tools create silos instead of partnerships. While FinOps should provide high-leverage impact across the organization, traditional solutions offer FinOps-focused functionality that is highly manual - leaving cloud teams struggling to implement optimization at scale in dynamic environments.

## Business Risk Exposure:

Traditional approaches create a cascade of inefficiency - throwing manual tasks 'over the wall' to engineering teams leads to deep backlogs of opportunity where wasted dollars grow exponentially. At the same time, rigid optimization workflows exist outside of users' native processes and too often lead to disruptive changes that impact business continuity. The outcome is less trust and participation in FinOps, with organizations facing millions in annual cloud waste.

## Value Proposition Statement:

CloudBolt transforms optimization from aspiration to automation. By converting manual tasks into continuous, intelligent workflows that integrate seamlessly with engineering processes, we help organizations finally close the insight-to-action gap and maximize their cloud ROI.

## Proof Points:

- Insight-to-action time reduced from weeks to minutes
    
- Automate 100% of your IaaS Optimization
    
- Optimization policies codified into workflows, eliminating manual interventions
    
- High collaboration achieved between engineering, platform, and FinOps teams
    
- Quantify accrued savings and projected opportunity costs continuously tracked
