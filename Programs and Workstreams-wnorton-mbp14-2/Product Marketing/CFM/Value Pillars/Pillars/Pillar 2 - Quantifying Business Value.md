### Market Problem

Organizations are inundated with cloud consumption data but lack actionable insights. While data volume has grown exponentially, the tools and processes to contextualize this data into meaningful business intelligence have lagged behind. As decision-making becomes more distributed across teams, businesses face mounting pressure to align cloud investments with strategic goals.

### Business Evolution

The challenge isn't collecting data—it’s transforming it into actionable insights that reach the right stakeholders at the right time. Traditional tools fail to bridge the gap between raw consumption metrics and contextually relevant business intelligence. This results in siloed teams, fragmented decision-making, and missed opportunities for optimization.

### Hurdles & Challenges

Without contextual intelligence, enterprises risk making multi-million-dollar cloud investment decisions in the dark. This isn’t just about cost overruns; it’s about missed opportunities for innovation and competitive advantage. The inability to align cloud spend with business drivers exposes organizations to inefficiencies, strategic missteps, and diminished ROI.
