## Summary
Meeting focused on urgent action items related to the expiration of CloudBolt's GigaOm radar report access on April 19th. The team discussed how to update website content, landing pages, email workflows, and merchandising to transition from GigaOm report access to their own competitive comparison guides for Cloud Checker, CloudHealth, Morpheus, and CloudAbility.

## Discussion Notes
- **Current MOFU Architecture Overview**:
    - Single MOFU form gates access to multiple content types (analyst reports, competitive guides, webinars)
    - When users submit the form, they're added to specific lists based on content requested
    - Automated emails with download links are sent based on content type
- **GigaOm Access Expiration**:
    - Access to GigaOm radar report expires April 19th (Saturday)
    - Need to remove GigaOm merchandising and redirect links
    - Plan to implement 301 redirects to GigaOm's site for any lingering URLs
- **Competitive Guide Assets**:
    - Team has existing comparison guides for Cloud Health, Morpheus, Cloud Checker, and CloudAbility
    - Assets were updated in January and are ready to be used as replacements
    - These guides are stored in the marketing team's creative documents folder
- **Landing Page Updates**:
    - Current landing pages reference GigaOm radar report and need revision
    - Team decided to use simpler landing page format with minimal copy changes
    - Same MOFU form will be used across all competitive guides
- **Email Automation Workflow**:
    - Need to create separate email templates for each competitor
    - Joanne will clone existing email templates and customize for each competitor
    - Charles will provide UTM-tagged permalink links for each guide
