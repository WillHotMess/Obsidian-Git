**Title:** CloudBolt + StormForge: ML-Powered Kubernetes Optimization Without Sacrificing Engineering Control

**Body:**
Engineers know the struggle: 70% of Kubernetes overspend comes from overprovisioning. You want performance, but finance wants efficiency. We're changing that equation.

CloudBolt has acquired StormForge to create something that's been missing in Kubernetes managementâ€”a practical, closed-loop system that respects your engineering workflow while eliminating waste.

Our patent-pending machine learning engine doesn't just make blind recommendations. It learns your specific workload patterns and automatically adjusts resource requests and limits in real-time, working within the boundaries you define.

The system automatically fine-tunes HPA target utilization along with container resources, optimizing your entire cluster for both performance and cost. No more manual tuning exercises or blind cost-cutting.

Built by engineers for engineers, this technology was designed to enhance your workflow, not replace it. The platform provides the data you need to defend your decisions while reducing typical Kubernetes waste by up to 49% on average.

**Title:** Eliminate Manual Kubernetes Resource Tuning Without Compromising Application Performance

**Body:**
For Kubernetes engineers, resource management is a constant balancing act. Overprovision and waste money. Underprovision and risk application performance issues.

With CloudBolt's acquisition of StormForge, that struggle is over. Our integrated solution brings together CloudBolt's multi-cloud analysis capabilities with StormForge's machine learning optimization to create a system that automatically and continuously optimizes your Kubernetes environment.

The technology:

- Applies predictive scaling based on learned workload patterns
- Automatically adjusts HPA settings for optimal utilization
- Fine-tunes container resource requests and limits in real-time
- Provides transparent justification for all optimization decisions

Unlike other tools that offer generic recommendations or override engineering decisions, our platform works within parameters you control. The result? An average reduction in container costs without performance compromises.

Developed by engineers who understand the real-world constraints teams operate under, this is optimization that respects your workflow and expertise.
