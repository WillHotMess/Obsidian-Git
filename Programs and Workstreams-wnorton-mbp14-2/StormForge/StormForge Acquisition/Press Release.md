# CloudBolt Acquires StormForge to Unlock Continuous Optimization for Kubernetes

## Delivers full-circle FinOps, bridging the "Insight to Action" gap and unleashing meaningful value from all cloud investments

**ROCKVILLE, MD, March 31, 2025** – CloudBolt Software, The Cloud ROI Company™ and a recognized leader in cloud cost management, today announced its acquisition of StormForge, the pioneer in machine learning-powered Kubernetes resource optimization. CloudBolt first partnered with StormForge in early 2024, when the company became the inaugural member of CloudBolt's Technical Alliance Program (TAP). With this acquisition, CloudBolt will integrate StormForge's patent-pending machine learning capabilities into its award-winning FinOps platform, creating the most advanced and complete Kubernetes FinOps solution available today.

As Kubernetes adoption accelerates, organizations face increasing challenges around cost management, performance, and visibility. According to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes deployments have driven up cloud spend for 49% of organizations, with 70% attributing overspend directly to workload overprovisioning. Research shows that over 65% of containers use less than half of their requested CPU resources, indicating significant inefficiencies. CloudBolt's acquisition of StormForge tackles these challenges head-on by providing a comprehensive solution that closes the FinOps loop, enabling businesses to inform, optimize, and operate with unprecedented efficiency.

StormForge's patent-pending machine learning technology enables enterprises to optimize Kubernetes workloads safely, automatically, and at scale. Unlike manual approaches that require specialized knowledge and constant attention, StormForge automatically adjusts resource requests and limits to match actual demand, eliminating the risk of performance issues while ensuring seamless optimization across all Kubernetes deployments. Organizations can realize cost reductions of 50% or more while maintaining or improving application performance.

"StormForge's innovative approach to Kubernetes optimization aligns perfectly with our vision," said Craig Hinkley, CEO of CloudBolt. "This acquisition is like two pieces of a puzzle snapping into place, seamlessly integrating their advanced machine learning capabilities into our 3rd-generation FinOps platform. The market has been demanding a unified, intelligent solution to manage costs and optimize Kubernetes operations—together, we're delivering exactly that."

Since unveiling its Augmented FinOps plans in January 2024, CloudBolt has led the market in AI/ML-driven FinOps, starting with the launch of the new CloudBolt Platform in October to drive complete cloud lifecycle optimization. The acquisition of StormForge accelerates CloudBolt's innovation roadmap, solidifying its leadership in intelligent cloud optimization by bringing AI/ML-driven automation to container environments. By enabling FinOps and Platform Engineering teams to unlock new levels of cloud ROI—including across previously isolated Kubernetes investments—CloudBolt's Augmented FinOps vision is now a reality.

"By combining our intelligent Kubernetes optimization platform with CloudBolt's industry-leading cloud cost visibility, we're revolutionizing how organizations manage their Kubernetes environments," said Rod Squires, CEO of StormForge. "Our shared goal is clear: to empower FinOps leaders with the tools they need to break open the longstanding 'black box' of cloud spending. Together, we're making Kubernetes optimization smarter, more transparent, and more actionable than ever before."

"This acquisition creates a powerhouse in the cloud cost optimization space," said Jane Smith, Principal Analyst at CloudMarket Research. "The combination of CloudBolt's comprehensive FinOps capabilities with StormForge's Kubernetes-specific machine learning technology addresses one of the most significant pain points for enterprises today. Organizations can now implement a truly unified approach to cloud cost management across their entire infrastructure."

Following the acquisition, StormForge's COO Yasmin Rajabi will join CloudBolt's Executive Team as its new Chief Strategy Officer to ensure a smooth transition and accelerate the development and rollout of the integrated solution, while continuing to maximize value for customers, prospects, and partners. The integrated platform is expected to launch in Q3 2025.
