### Website Update Sequence

#### StormForge Site Updates

- Ticker banner scheduled for 9:00 AM
- Homepage edit scheduled for 9:00 AM
- All managed through Craft CMS

#### Technical Considerations

- CloudBolt site lacks staging environment, requiring direct production updates
- No ability to create drafts for existing pages, requiring clone-edit-push workflow
- Charles will need press release URL for blog post link
- Free trial dropdown update from Bonfire expected Monday afternoon

### Email Communications Strategy

#### CloudBolt Customer Email

- Personalized email coming from Craig's email address
- Contains three CTAs: free trial, sandbox, and CSM contact
- Team decided against separate "Request StormForge Demo" button, consolidating with CSM contact
- Email replies will go to no-reply@cloudbolt.io instead of CS distribution to avoid overwhelming CS team
- Will be sent approximately 9:15-9:30 AM after confirming website updates

#### CloudBolt Prospect Email

- Coming from Craig's email
- Sending to CloudBolt prospects
- Similar CTAs to customer email
- Replies will go to no-reply@cloudbolt.io

#### StormForge Prospect Email

- Scheduled for 12:00 PM Eastern
- Managed through Pardot
- Yasmin has access to check/send if needed
- Lindsey configured scheduling

### Form Configuration Discussion

#### Demo Request Form

- Debate about where "Schedule a StormForge Demo" button should link:
    - Nick suggested StormForge contact page
    - Team ultimately decided to use CloudBolt's demo request form
    - William to add "Kubernetes optimization" checkbox option to existing form
- Concern about pre-populated checkboxes on form
- Charles will update form page text to acknowledge StormForge/CloudBolt connection

### Social Media Strategy

    - "We've got big news" message with logo-merging gif
    - Link to acquisition resource hub

    - Same destination and visual elements
