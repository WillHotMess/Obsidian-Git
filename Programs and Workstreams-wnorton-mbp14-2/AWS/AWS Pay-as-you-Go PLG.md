## Attendees

## Summary
The meeting focused on discussing the implementation of a Product-Led Growth (PLG) strategy through AWS Marketplace's Seller Prime program. Edaria presented the proposal, highlighting how StormForge has been accepted into AWS's exclusive Seller Prime program, which includes $40K in Marketing Development Funds (MDF). The team discussed the potential benefits of adopting this PLG approach to accelerate sales cycles, particularly for enterprises, and how the AWS marketplace integration could provide a more streamlined purchasing experience.

## Agenda
- Review of PLG strategy and rationale
- Discussion of AWS Marketplace Seller Prime program
- Analysis of funding requirements and MDF utilization
- Consideration of implementation challenges
- Exploration of integration with existing marketing efforts

## Discussion Notes
- Edaria presented historical context showing that in 2023, StormForge had good conversion rates from trials but faced long sales cycles with enterprise customers, making year-end closures challenging.
- A Q4 2024 test allowed free trials through AWS marketplace, resulting in two conversions that closed within 45 days.
- AWS is investing in PLG motions through their Marketplace Seller Prime program, which StormForge has been accepted into as one of 200 participants in 2025.
- The program provides $40K in MDF if StormForge can drive specific visitor metrics (initially 150 unique visitors, scaling to 350).
- Data from pilot partners showed substantial increases in private offer opportunities within three quarters, with one example partner reaching $4M in ARR by the end of year two.
- Current StormForge sales motion requires targeting practitioners, then finding economic buyers, educating them, and negotiating large enterprise deals based on CPU licensing.
- The team is regularly having to downsize deals to get initial customer commitment, then expand.
- PLG approach would flip this model, allowing faster onboarding and value realization, particularly appropriate for StormForge's product where value is quickly demonstrable.
- The PLG strategy would work alongside existing sales-led motions rather than replacing them.
- StormForge is also working with AWS's EKS Automotive team on Greenfield EKS deployments, which could benefit from this PLG approach.
- William raised questions about the implementation of the free trial functionality within the product.
- Edaria mentioned "buy with AWS" features that would allow embedding AWS Marketplace elements (like trial buttons) directly into StormForge's digital properties.
