# CAST.ai Free Trial Analysis: Practical Recommendations for Our PLG Strategy

## To: Leadership Team

## From: William Norton

## Subject: CAST.ai PLG Strategy Assessment - Practical Recommendations for StormForge

I recently explored CAST.ai's free trial process and discovered several important qualification methods they're employing to balance frictionless access with quality lead capture. As our top direct competitor, I believe their approach warrants serious consideration.

## Key Findings:
1. **Email Validation**: CAST.ai blocks personal email addresses (Gmail, etc.) while allowing business emails.  While not foolproof (an .edu email worked), this simple gate significantly reduces "ghost" leads.
2. **Required Registration Data**: Unlike our current approach, during the first sign-in, Cast collects:
    - Business email
    - Full name
    - Phone number
    - Company name
    - Job title (from predetermined options, not free text)
3. **Guided User Experience**:
    - In-product guided tour upon first login
    - Clear user pathways to value
    - Timed questionnaires that appear during product exploration
    - Contextual information collection at critical moments

Currently, our StormForge free trial approach lacks all of these qualification steps.

## What We're Doing to Increase Conversion Now:
Starting next week, we're implementing a free trial nurture program that builds on the current approach (which only includes "welcome" and "trial expiration" emails). The new nurture strategy includes:
1. **Bifurcated User Journey**: We've designed separate email paths for users who install vs. those who don't, with each path addressing specific conversion barriers.
2. **Strategic Touchpoints**: Increased from just 2 to 8+ strategic touchpoints throughout the trial journey, including installation guidance, recommendation reviews, and technical integration support.
3. **Conversion Approach**: Clear pathways to both self-service AWS Marketplace purchases and sales-assisted conversations.

## Next steps

We should explore these options to see if we can maintain our PLG motion while significantly improving lead quality and conversion rates.  Rather than focusing exclusively on increasing top-of-funnel volume, we can dramatically improve conversion rates of existing traffic.

**CAST.ai Free Trial Analysis: Practical Recommendations for Our PLG Strategy** 

I recently conducted a competitive analysis of CAST.ai's free trial process and identified several key qualification methods they utilize to strike a balance between frictionless access and effective lead capture. As a top competitor, their approach deserves our serious attention. 

**Key Findings:** 
1. **Email Validation:** CAST.ai blocks personal email addresses (such as Gmail) while allowing only business emails. Although not infallible, this simple measure significantly reduces the number of unqualified leads. 
2. **Required Registration Information:** Unlike our current process, they collect the following data during registration: 
	- Business email
	- Full name
	- Phone number
	- Company name 
	- Job title (chosen from predetermined options rather than free text) 
3. **Guided User Experience:** 
	- An in-product guided tour is provided upon the first login. 
	- Clear pathways to value are established for users. 
	- Timed questionnaires appear during early product exploration (TypeForm)

Our current approach to free trials at StormForge lacks many of these qualification steps, based on assumptions that: - Engineers will not provide business information. - Competitors do not gate their trials. - Frictionless access is the only effective PLG model. My analysis directly contradicts these assumptions, indicating that our main competitor successfully integrates product-led growth (PLG) with appropriate lead qualification. 

**Recommendations:** 1. **Implement Basic Qualification:** Introduce business email validation and essential contact information collection during the trial sign-up process. 2. **Develop In-Product Guidance:** Create guided tours that simultaneously assist users in navigation and collect valuable qualification data. 3. **Implement Progressive Profiling:** Use timed typeforms to gather additional information while users explore and derive value from the product. 4. **Align Marketing Attribution:** Enhance tracking capabilities to connect trials to pipeline and revenue, ensuring that proper credit is given to marketing-sourced opportunities. The evidence indicates that we can maintain our PLG approach while significantly improving lead quality and conversion rates. Instead of focusing solely on increasing top-of-funnel volume, we can potentially enhance conversion rates for existing traffic. I am available to discuss this analysis in greater detail at your convenience and would appreciate your support in advocating for these changes within our product and marketing teams.
