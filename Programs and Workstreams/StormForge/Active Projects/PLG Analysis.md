**Leaders,**
I spent some time navigating CAST.ai's free trial process and discovered several qualification methods they're using to balance frictionless access with quality lead capture.  As our top direct competitor, their approach would be a good one to consider.

**Findings: (Screenshots attached)**
**Email Validation**: CAST.ai blocks personal email addresses (Gmail, etc.) while allowing business emails. While not foolproof (an .edu email worked), this simple gate significantly reduces "ghost" leads. They also require email confirmation for non-connected options before proceeding, adding a verification step.

**Required Registration Data**:  At the first sign-in, Cast requires:
·        Business email
·        Full name
·        Phone number
·        Company name
·        Job title (from predetermined options, not free text)
**Guided User Experience**:

·        In-product guided tour upon first login

·        Timed questionnaires that appear during product exploration (using TypeForm)

·        Contextual information collection at critical moments

**In-Product Resources & Conversion Points**:

·        Educational videos, demos, and tutorials placed throughout the user journey

·        Help guides are accessible at potential friction points

·        Contextual "Talk to Product Team" and "Book a Demo" prompts that appear based on user behavior

·        Smart timing of conversion offers based on feature exploration

We should explore these options to see if we can maintain our PLG motion while improving lead quality and conversion rates.  Rather than focusing exclusively on increasing top-of-funnel volume, these approaches may help improve the conversion rates of existing traffic without reducing the customer experience.

**What We're Doing to Increase Conversion Now:**

Starting this week, we're implementing a free trial nurture program that builds on the current approach (which only includes "welcome" and "trial expiration" emails).

The new nurture strategy includes:

·        **Bifurcated User Journey**: We've designed separate email paths for users who install vs. those who don't, with each path addressing specific conversion barriers.

·        **Strategic Touchpoints**: Increased from just 2 to 8+ strategic touchpoints throughout the trial journey, including installation guidance, recommendation reviews, and technical integration support.

·        **Conversion Approach**: Clear pathways to both self-service AWS Marketplace purchases and sales-assisted conversations.

Let me know if you have any questions.
