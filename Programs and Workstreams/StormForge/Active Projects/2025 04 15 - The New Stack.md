## Discussion Notes
- Jessica manages the ARM credit portfolio marketing program for three Insight Partners media properties: The New Stack, Roadmap, and Towards Data Science.
- The program gives portfolio companies differentiated access to DevOps and AI-focused audiences.
- Program goals include building brand credibility, connecting with targeted leads, and driving overall brand awareness.
- The New Stack (TNS) is a 10-year-old DevOps news analysis site with strong industry reputation.
- Roadmap is a developer education platform offering workshops, skills training, and roadmaps for skill development (40% US, 60% international audience).
- Towards Data Science (TDS) is an AI-focused news publisher with content from industry contributors.
- All three properties reach approximately 3-3.5 million users monthly and continue to grow despite industry challenges.
- StormForge previously had strong performance with The New Stack articles, with one article from two years ago still driving conversations at trade shows.
- This year, portfolio companies can be designated as "contributors" rather than "sponsors," providing SEO benefits.
- New data management platform allows for tracking and identifying users who read specific content, enabling data-enriched lead generation.
- Jessica occasionally has free ad inventory available for portfolio companies in newsletters and on websites.
- For larger content pieces like guides and research reports, Jessica suggested creating unique articles linking back to the gated content on CloudBolt's site.
- The New Stack has an event calendar that can promote webinars and virtual events for the launch of major content assets.
