**Craig Hinkley (CEO, CloudBolt):**Today marks an important milestone in Kubernetes management as we welcome StormForge to the CloudBolt family. A significant percentage of enterprises face unnecessary costs due to Kubernetes overprovisioning – a challenge we're now better positioned to address.By combining CloudBolt's multi-cloud analysis with StormForge's machine learning optimization, we've created something that's been missing in the market: a practical, closed-loop system for container resource management. This strategic move accelerates our big bet on AI and automation as the future of FinOps.

**John Platt of StormForge**Kubernetes adoption continues to accelerate, but with it, comes technical complexity and cost inefficiencies. In our work with engineering teams, we've consistently seen the challenge of balancing performance requirements with resource efficiency. Our combined solution applies predictive scaling based on workload patterns and real-time tuning – reducing waste by an average of XX% without compromising application performance. This partnership brings together cost visibility and automated optimization in a way that respects the engineering workflow.

**[Craig Hinkley]**This integration is about more than just integration—it's about transformation. We're breaking down the 'black box' of Kubernetes spending and giving teams precision tools they actually want to use. Engineers maintain control over their optimization parameters while gaining the insights needed to defend their decisions with data. And the best part? This technology was developed by engineers who understand the real-world constraints teams operate under.

**[John Platt]**StormForge was founded with a mission—to bring intelligence, automation, and efficiency to Kubernetes environments. With CloudBolt, we're extending that approach across the entire cloud estate. Our optimization engine works by learning the specific characteristics of your workloads, then making adjustments within boundaries you define. It's transparent, configurable, and designed to respect engineering decisions rather than override them—bringing unprecedented precision to Kubernetes resource management.

**[Craig Hinkley]**This acquisition is a natural fit—two complementary technologies coming together to create a complete solution for cloud cost optimization. As strategic partners over the previous years, we've implemented this approach with shared customers and seen the concrete results. Today, we solidify going forward together as we focus on achieving a common mission: to make FinOps intelligence contextual, actionable, and engineer-approved. With StormForge now part of CloudBolt, we're bringing our vision of true hybrid multi-cloud cost optimization to life. The next level of Kubernetes efficiency starts now. And it's just the beginning.
