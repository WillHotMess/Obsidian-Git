## Summary

This meeting focused on aligning AWS partnership strategy following the CloudBolt-StormForge integration. Key topics included the role of PAYGO (Pay As You Go) in the go-to-market strategy, AWS Marketplace initiatives, and upcoming AWS PartnerCast opportunities. The team identified a need for clearer strategic direction on how to position PAYGO offerings and integrate StormForge's AWS partnership approach with CloudBolt's broader strategy.

## Discussion Notes

### PAYGO Strategy Discussion

- **Current State Analysis**:
    - PAYGO was implemented at StormForge to address a "black hole" in the mid-to-bottom funnel
    - Currently, ~80% of trial users don't convert, and there's limited follow-up/nurturing
    - PAYGO offers an alternative for customers who don't want to commit to larger contracts
- **Strategic Questions**:
    - William highlighted the need for executive alignment on PAYGO positioning: "At what level do we want to push PAYGO?"
    - Options range from passive availability to active marketing to "full court press"
    - Need to determine if PAYGO is the primary, secondary, or situational go-to-market approach
- **Considerations**:
    - PAYGO is critical for co-selling with AWS: "Everything that AWS sells is pay as you go"
    - Potential margin implications and risk of cannibalizing other offerings
    - PAYGO pricing is intentionally premium (~3x higher for enterprise customers) to encourage enterprise deals
- **AWS Marketplace Program**:
    - StormForge enrolled in AWS Marketplace demand generation program with $40K MDF
    - Program metrics focus on driving 100 unique visitors to marketplace listing, scaling to 300/month
    - Current engagement includes tracking links on StormForge pages

### AWS PartnerCast Planning
- Need to determine topic and presenter for July PartnerCast opportunity
- Previous May 28th PartnerCast focused on value propositions for ISVs and service partners
- Review of AWS PartnerCast examples shows mostly technical content
- Team discussing potential focus areas:
    - FinOps capabilities
    - Building AI applications on AWS
    - CSP reseller strategy
    - Need to identify appropriate technical presenter (not exclusively marketing-led)

### AWS Partnership Philosophy
- William expressed strong support for cloud provider partnerships: "Working with cloud providers to go to market is my bread and butter"
- Erwin noted StormForge has historically been "AWS-led" in strategy
- Discussion of potential reassessment of how AWS-centric the go-to-market approach should be
- Need to audit current AWS engagement across all products, not just StormForge
