## Agenda

1. AWS PartnerCast planning & focus
2. AWS partnership credentials & requirements
3. AWS marketplace listings strategy

## Discussion Notes

- **PartnerCast Focus**: Team aligned on using BillOps as the topic for the upcoming AWS PartnerCast, focusing on the value proposition for MSPs.
    
    - William and Peter (with possibly Kyle) identified as presenters
    - Need to develop compelling story highlighting customer pain points rather than just product features
    - Target timeframe: Mid-July (avoiding August due to summer vacations)
- **AWS Partner Credentials**:
    
    - CSMP product needs Foundational Technical Review (FTR) for co-sell authorization
    - New Gen AI-powered FTR review process potentially available
    - Cloud Operations competency (including financial operations) identified as priority
    - Competency requires valid FTR first
    - Team believes they have most required materials (architecture diagrams, security reports, deployment guides)
- **AWS Marketplace Strategy**:
    
    - Decision to maintain separate marketplace listings for different products rather than one combined listing
    - Need to update listings with clear product names (avoid acronyms like CSMP)
    - Listings need improved copy/content and descriptions
    - Need to align marketplace content with PartnerCast messaging
- **MSP Targeting**:
    
    - Identified key lighthouse customers: GeCom (recently acquired Inti), RedApt, Proficient, Lumen/Sirion
    - Common value proposition across MSPs: replacing manual Excel/Power BI processes, handling scaling challenges, improving accuracy
    - Strategy to use Ross to connect with AWS Partner Sales Managers (PSMs) who work with MSPs
    - Need case studies and "wind wires" to establish credibility with AWS team

## Action Items

- [ ] **Erwin**: Set up FTR submission for CSMP product, exploring Gen AI auto-approval workflow
- [ ] **Erwin**: Work with Sandy to gain access to AWS marketplace listings
- [ ] **William & Erwin**: Create/update copy for AWS marketplace listings
- [ ] **Erwin**: Submit application for AWS Cloud Operations competency once FTR is complete
- [ ] **William**: Create abstract for BillOps PartnerCast
- [ ] **Erwin**: Gather PartnerCast program information and share with William via Slack
- [ ] **William**: Compile case studies and "wind wires" for AWS team (Data Three, Proficient, Lumen/Sirion)
- [ ] **Erwin**: Confirm with Steve that this work is a priority Q2 MBO

## Follow-up

- Next meeting date: Bi-weekly cadence (approximately May 21, 2025)
- Erwin to provide update on FTR, competency, and marketplace listings progress
- Post-FinOpsX: Prepare formal request for Ross to connect with relevant AWS PSMs
