# 2025 SOLUTION BRIEF

# EKS Auto Mode + StormForge

## Intelligent Cloud Cost Optimization for Amazon EKS

### Top benefits:
- **50%+ reduction** in Kubernetes-related cloud costs
- **Automated resource management** without deep Kubernetes expertise
- **Bidimensional scaling** that ensures both cost efficiency and reliability
- **Machine learning-powered** pod rightsizing and optimization

### Key strengths:
- **EKS Auto Mode** automates cluster management, security, and maintenance
- **StormForge Optimize Live** rightsizes pods automatically using machine learning
- **Complete solution** addresses both cluster and pod-level efficiency
- **Eliminates scaling conflicts** by coordinating vertical and horizontal scaling
- **Reduces operational burden** allowing teams to focus on innovation

### Better together:
Amazon EKS Auto Mode provides intelligent cluster autoscaling that reduces infrastructure costs by selecting optimal compute instances, but doesn't address pod-level efficiency. According to CNCF, 70% of cloud overspending comes from improper pod resource requests.

StormForge complements EKS Auto Mode by:
- Automatically rightsizing pod CPU and memory settings
- Ensuring HPA scaling behavior works synergistically with vertical pod changes
- Maximizing pod-level efficiency without risking performance or reliability
- Streamlining pod placement for optimal bin packing on nodes

## "Deploy Amazon EKS Auto Mode and StormForge together to maximize efficiency — automatically and intelligently."
