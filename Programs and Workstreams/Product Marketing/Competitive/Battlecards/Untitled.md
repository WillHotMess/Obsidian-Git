Core to CloudBolt's DNA is:
- Scalable, enterprise-ready, automation,
- True multi-hybrid cloud support,
- and the critical intersection, where performance, governance, and cost awareness converge.

These principles exist across our entire portfolio, from Cloud Financial Management to Hybrid Cloud Management and Orchestration to StormForge.

As public and private cloud responsibilities increasingly overlap between teams, our integrated solutions address these converging priorities while delivering value individually. 

Whether you're using one solution or several, we're committed to maximizing your cloud investment through intelligent management tailored to your unique journey.

### The Announcement
I'm excited to share that **StormForge is now part of the CloudBolt portfolio**. 
StormForge was the **first partner in our Technology Alliance Program** because they share our commitment to continuous optimization principles. 

- Kubernetes adoption continues to accelerate across on-premises, multi-cloud, and hybrid environments
- Traditional optimization approaches fall short for containerized workloads
- You need more advanced, modernized coverage beyond VMs, databases, and storage
- Cost allocation for Kubernetes workloads has been complex and inaccurate

**Real-Time Kubernetes Optimization**
- Collects metrics every 30 seconds in near real-time
- AI/ML-powered analysis of actual resource needs

**Customizable Optimization Approach**
- Sets optimal requests and limits per container (not cluster-wide)
- Individual models for each workload; setting to be more aggressive on cost savings or conservative on reliability
- Prevents both under-provisioning and over-provisioning: 
- Maintains performance while optimizing costs

**3. Automated Implementation**
- Multiple deployment options: direct patching, CI/CD webhooks, or your preferred method
- No manual intervention required

**4. Enhanced Cost Allocation**
- Granular usage data enables accurate cost distribution
- Allocate Kubernetes cluster costs to specific applications based on actual consumption
- Move beyond simple proportional cost distribution methods
