> **Out with the old and in with the new**
> 
> The Public Cloud 'BIG PROMISE' was that businesses would easily be able to optimize their spend and only pay for what they use. In practice this hasn't always been the case. On average, businesses are seeing that 20-35% of their Public Cloud resources are under-utilized.
> 
> Demand for cloud applications and infrastructure varies widely from customer to customer and it isn't uncommon for companies to over-provision and end up with numerous resources not in use. This often goes unnoticed - until now!
