**Title:** The Fast-Get-Faster Effect: Breaking the FinOps Status Quo
**Subhead:** Accelerating from Insight to Action in a Cloud+ World

## Slide 1: How many of you have seen _Interstellar_?

- **Tell:**  
	- Let’s start with a show of hands—who here has seen _Interstellar_? If you have, you’ll remember the scene on Miller’s planet, where every hour spent on the surface equals seven years back on Earth. That’s time dilation : the closer you are to a massive gravitational force, the slower time moves for you compared to everyone else.  
	- Now, think about your FinOps process. While you’re stuck in a slow, manual optimization loop—spending weeks deliberating—companies with advanced automation are completing dozens of optimization cycles. Your cloud waste isn’t standing still while you wait; it’s compounding every hour, just like the years ticking by for Cooper’s daughter back on Earth.
    
## Slide 2: Let’s use a more relevant metaphor: Jetstream Travel

- **Show:**  
    A striking visual: a map with a fast-moving jet stream (250 mph) slicing across the globe, contrasted with sluggish, stagnant air masses.
    
- **Tell:**  
    - Let’s bring it back to Earth. In the atmosphere, jet streams are narrow bands of fast-moving air that can reach speeds of 250 mph. Climate science shows that the fastest parts of the jet stream are accelerating 2.5 times faster than average winds.  
    - Organizations with fast optimization cycles are like planes riding the jet stream—they don’t just maintain their advantage, they expand it exponentially. Meanwhile, those stuck in slow-moving air fall further and further behind. The gap isn’t just persistent—it’s widening.

## Slide 3: So how do we get our organizations into the jet stream?

- **Tell:**  
	- How do we move from the stagnant, slow-moving air into the high-velocity jet stream of continuous optimization? 
	- Our answer is to reimagine our FinOps process—not as a monthly reporting exercise, but as a continuous, automated loop that’s always moving, always learning, always optimizing.
    
## Slide 4: The Continuous Optimization Loop
**What Your FinOps Process Should Look Like**
- **Show:**  
    -  circular loop model with waypoints: anomaly occurrence, insight, evaluation, prioritization, action.
    
- **Tell:**  
	- The industry has been selling you on reporting tools, but what you really need is a continuous action framework. When this loop is working, you’re not waiting for the next monthly report—you’re detecting, evaluating, and acting in near real-time.  
	- Organizations that operate in this mode don’t just keep up—they accelerate, compounding their advantage with every cycle

## Slide 5: Two-Speed Reality: Insight to Action

- **Show:**  
- A dual-loop visual:
	- Outer loop (manual): slow, red, with a waste ticker rapidly climbing.
	- Inner loop (automated): fast, green, with waste quickly addressed and reset.
    
- **Tell:**  
	- Let’s bring back the _Interstellar_ analogy. While you’re spending weeks in the outer loop, companies with advanced automation are completing dozens of optimization cycles. Your cloud waste isn’t standing still while you deliberate—it’s compounding every hour.  
	- The difference between the slow lane and the jet stream isn’t just speed—it’s survival.
## Slides 6–XX: The Waypoints (Examples)

- **Detection:**  
	- If you're relying on monthly cost reports to identify issues, you're already too late. We've consistently seen that organizations need multi-cloud telemetry that processes in real-time. Not tomorrow, not next week—NOW. What's your current detection latency? Hours? Days? That's all waste you're accumulating.
    
- **Insight:**  
	- You're probably getting plenty of data from your current tools, but let's be honest—how much of it leads to actual optimization? We've developed a three-tier approach to insights: inherent baseline metrics, ML-recognized patterns, and what really matters—shaped insights that align with your specific business priorities.
	- **StormForge Example**
    
- **Evaluation:**  
	- In our work with enterprise customers, we've found that most of evaluation time is spent on obvious optimizations. Your talented engineers shouldn't be manually reviewing whether an idle instance should be shut down. Your FinOps tooling should handle this automatically through well-defined policies and ML-driven assessment.
	- **CloudEagle Example**
    
- **Prioritization:**  
	- Most organizations are chasing the biggest cost items regardless of implementation complexity. But what if I told you we've helped customers achieve 2x the ROI by focusing on medium-cost, low-complexity optimizations first? Your prioritization needs to account for both impact AND implementation effort. Otherwise, you're leaving the easiest money on the table.
	- **Cloud Native Actions**
    
- **Action:**  
	- How many optimization recommendations from your current tools actually get implemented? Our customers tell us it's typically less than 30%. That's because most FinOps tools stop at recommendations. Real value comes from execution integration—turning insights directly into action through your existing workflows, with proper governance.

## Closing: A Nod to _Interstellar_

- **Tell:**  
	- To close, remember: in _Interstellar_, the tragedy wasn’t just the years lost—it was the opportunity cost. Don’t let your organization spend years in the slow lane while others are compounding their advantage in the jet stream.  
	- The future of FinOps isn’t about waiting for the next cycle. It’s about continuous, real-time action—riding the jet stream, not stuck in the time dilation trap.
