Subject: Private Briefing: How CloudBolt's StormForge Acquisition Addresses the Kubernetes Optimization Gap

Hello,

As we approach FinOps X San Diego, I wanted to extend a personal invitation to meet with CloudBolt's leadership team for an exclusive analyst briefing on our strategic direction following the StormForge acquisition.

Our recent market analysis revealed a significant opportunity: while 98% of IT leaders prioritize Kubernetes optimization, only 8% can effectively execute on it. Our acquisition directly addresses this gap, creating what we believe is the most comprehensive platform bridging FinOps and Platform Engineering personas.

**Who you'll meet:**

- Kyle Campos, Chief Technology & Product Officer
- Yasmin, Chief Strategy Officer (former StormForge Product Leader)
- Mark Zembal, CMO
- Will Norton, VP of Product Marketing

**What we'll discuss:**

- Strategic vision: Unifying financial visibility with automated optimization actions
- Customer impact: How DirecTV achieved 30-60% infrastructure savings with our combined solution
- Market differentiation: Moving beyond visibility to automated remediation
- Roadmap: Our FOCUS-native data platform and continuous optimization capabilities
- Q&A: Addressing your specific questions about our competitive positioning

We've seen tremendous market validation already, with 21% ASP growth and increasing enterprise adoption. I'd value your perspective on how we're addressing the convergence of financial and operational concerns we're seeing across all cloud stakeholders.

Please select a time that works for you: [https://cloudbolt-io.chilipiper.com/me/william-norton/finops-x-2025](https://cloudbolt-io.chilipiper.com/me/william-norton/finops-x-2025)

Looking forward to a productive conversation,

Will Norton VP of Product Marketing CloudBolt Software
