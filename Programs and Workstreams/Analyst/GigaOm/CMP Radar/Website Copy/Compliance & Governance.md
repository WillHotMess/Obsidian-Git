## Confidently accelerate cloud adoption

### Secure, Compliant, and Financially-Aware Cloud Management

**Paved Roads:** Steer towards controlled agility

_Steer towards controlled agility_

Steer towards controlled agility by removing slowdowns. Allow users to consume cloud quicker using approved blueprints that guarantee alignment with all critical business requirements.

**Proactive Financial Control:** Financial implications in center stage

_Financial implications in center stage_

Get cost right from the start by putting financial guardrails center stage. Compare options, automate approvals, and bake-in budget limits upfront to minimize waste.

**Hardened Cloud Security:** Hardened cloud deployments by design

_Hardened cloud deployments by design_

Innovate fearlessly by automatically integrating security, compliance, and controls into every phase of the cloud lifecycle so risk protection is never an afterthought.

## ==Elevating efficiency, reducing decision-making time==

In an environment where approximately 20% of time is lost in decision-making, CloudBolt offers a better approach solution. Its intelligent platform integrates security, compliance, and financial control into cloud management, significantly reducing cognitive load and minimizing errors.

CloudBolt's approach to policy enforcement in the DevOps lifecycle accelerates release velocity without compromising oversight. By shifting policy enforcement, testing, and approvals earlier, it enables faster, more efficient decision-making. Regulations are embedded as code with automatic validation, fostering an environment of innovation with reduced risk.

At its core, CloudBolt ensures technical leaders retain visibility and control, empowering teams within secure, policy-driven guardrails. Automated compliance checks, restricted self-service consumption, and layered security integrations build oversight by design. This holistic approach to cloud management not only saves time but also empowers organizations to operate more effectively in the cloud.

### ==Clarity, Security, and Seamless Integration==

CloudBolt clarifies organizational hierarchy, displaying system order and usage. It triggers approval processes for both public and private clouds and sends group- and service-based alerts (development, test, etc.).

- **Contextual Access and Permissions:** Enforce least privileged access and zero trust security models using role-based access control, single sign-on, or OAuth protocols, enhancing security and trust.
    
- **Approval Frameworks**: Implement triggers for approval processes tailored to public and private clouds, using your preferred ITSM or chat tools, ensuring efficient and controlled cloud actions.
    
- **Alerting and Communication Framework:** Incorporate alerting and chat integration with tools like Slack, Teams, Email, and custom integrations like PagerDuty, facilitating timely notifications and efficient communication for different groups and services.

## Full-Lifecycle Financial Governance

_Today’s technical leaders require visibility and control over cloud budgets — without compromising agility. CloudBolt provides the guardrails and automation to align cloud utilization with business priorities._

**Budget-Aware Deployments**: Granularly define budgets at the group or resource level, integrating with existing financial data sources. Customizable alerts notify when utilization nears thresholds, ensuring informed governance.

**Cost Modeling**: Leverage real-time modeling of cost estimates pre-deployment, enabling data-driven provisioning aligned to capacity needs.

**Cost Quotas**: With CloudBolt, define quotas that specify either the maximum number of resources or the maximum cost teams can allocate, ensuring budget compliance.

**Automated Resource Scaling**: Autoscaling seamlessly responds to changes in demand, scaling infrastructure up or down based on predefined metrics. This maintains optimal performance, continuity, and stakeholder experiences.

**Lifecycle Administration**: Proactively identify unused resources through customizable workflows. Decommission based on expiration policies or integrate with DevOps toolchains. Reclaim up to 35% of cloud spend.
