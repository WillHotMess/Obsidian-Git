## Smarter cloud automation using advanced logic

_Advanced logic-driven orchestration ready for the dynamic needs of modern cloud infrastructures._

**Implicit Automation**: Automatically applies business logic to intuitively guide workflow selections, direct conditional branching, and autonomously allocate relevant metadata or parameters to workflow tasks.

**Conditionals**: Enable dynamic decision-making within workflows through "if-then-else" logic statements that trigger specific actions based on whether predefined criteria are met, allowing automation to respond adaptively to varying scenarios.

**Triggers**: Initiate the launch of automated workflows based on timed schedules, activity thresholds, completion of predecessor tasks, new data availability, or other events for flexible and customizable automation sequences.

**Concurrency**: Enable the simultaneous execution of multiple automation tasks at once, allowing independent steps to process in parallel to significantly enhance efficiency and reduce the time required to complete workflows.

**Parameterization**: Specify variables, inputs, configs, and other parameterized data to pass context-aware information into each step of an automation workflow.

**External Orchestration**: Coordinate the triggering, scheduling, monitoring, and hand-off of workflow automation tasks across multiple environments, tools, and platforms.

## There’s an automation for that…

_CloudBolt serves as the hub of automation capabilities spanning scheduling, events, on-demand and rules-based that can optimize and accelerate infrastructure operations._

**Schedule-driven:** This type of automation involves executing tasks on a predefined schedule, like running a backup job every 24 hours or scaling infrastructure capacity every Friday evening. Tools like CloudBolt allow users to set up scheduled, recurring actions.

**Event-based:** Event-based automation is triggered by events from within the infrastructure, such as a virtual machine reaching a certain CPU utilization threshold or an error being logged. It allows for just-in-time automation responses to real-time conditions through event monitoring and defined actions that are kicked off programmatically.

**On-demand:** On-demand automation allows users to trigger automation tasks manually as needed through a self-service portal. This provides more control and discretion over when scripts are executed versus scheduling or events triggering automated responses.

**Rule-Based:** Rule-based automation involves establishing policies, thresholds, and defined actions that should occur when infrastructure meets specified conditions. This allows setting up flexible “if-then” style automation rules, such as if a disk reaches 90% capacity then trigger a workflow to provision additional storage.
