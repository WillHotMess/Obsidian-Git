# CloudBolt HCM Product Development Roadmap

## 1. Cost Forecasting Engine

**Objective:** Integrate real customer discount rates and agreement data to provide accurate deployment cost forecasting at provisioning time.

**Features/Use Cases:**

- **Tenant-Specific Rate Application:** Automatically incorporates your organization's unique discount structures, custom agreements, and reserved instance benefits into deployment forecasts
- **Cross-Environment Cost Comparison:** Provides accurate comparison between private cloud and public cloud deployment options with real-world pricing
- **AI-Powered Optimization Suggestions:** Analyzes existing resource utilization patterns to recommend optimal configurations at deployment time
- **Right-Sizing Intelligence:** Identifies when resources are consistently over-provisioned and suggests appropriate adjustments before deployment
- **Cost Impact Analysis:** Simulates the financial impact of architectural decisions before implementation, enabling cost-aware design choices

## 2. AI Integration Framework

**Objective:** Extend StormForge ML modules to all workload types and implement natural language processing for blueprint creation.

**Features/Use Cases:**

- **Natural Language Blueprint Creation:** Describe what you want to build in plain language and let AI interpret and construct the appropriate deployment blueprint
- **Cross-Platform Workload Optimization:** Extends StormForge's proven Kubernetes optimization intelligence to all workload types across any cloud environment
- **Intelligent Workload Placement:** Recommends optimal deployment locations based on performance needs, compliance requirements, and cost considerations
- **Automated Resource Right-Sizing:** Continuously analyzes performance metrics to recommend or automatically implement resource adjustments
- **Predictive Anomaly Detection:** Identifies unusual usage patterns or potential issues before they impact performance or costs. Based on CloudBolt's Platform unique insights into customer environments, we will accurately flag patterns that have contributed to anomaly spikes instead of the generic market approach of overloading customers with low-value alerts

## 3. Zero-Touch Release System

**Objective:** Implement source code repository-integrated configuration management for CloudBolt environments to enable version-controlled infrastructure.

**Features/Use Cases:**

- **Complete Environment-as-Code:** Capture everything from blueprints to cloud states, naming conventions, and RBAC configurations in standardized, versioned code
- **Source Code Repository Integration:** Seamlessly store configurations in existing repositories (GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc.) for version tracking and compliance
- **One-Click Deployment:** Push button deployment of entire appliance configurations from development to production
- **Bi-Directional Synchronization:** Automatically sync changes made in the UI to repositories and vice versa
- **State-Aware Configuration Management:** Maintain snapshots of environment configurations with the ability to roll back or compare changes over time# CloudBolt HCM Product Development Roadmap

## 1. Cost Forecasting Engine

**Objective:** Integrate real customer discount rates and agreement data to provide accurate deployment cost forecasting at provisioning time.

**Technical Requirements:**

- Build API connections to pull tenant-specific discount rates and agreements from the cost platform
- Develop calculation engine to apply these rates to provisioned resources
- Create comparison logic between private cloud and public cloud costs
- Implement analysis capability for existing resource utilization patterns
- Design recommendation system based on historical usage data

**Development Considerations:**

- Need to ensure tenant data security and isolation
- Must handle various cloud provider pricing models
- Should account for reserved instances and savings plans
- Initial version to focus on EC2/VM resources, expand to storage and network later
- Consider leveraging existing ML modules from StormForge as foundation

## 2. AI Integration Framework

**Objective:** Extend StormForge ML modules to all workload types and implement natural language processing for blueprint creation.

**Technical Requirements:**

- Create abstraction layer to apply StormForge ML algorithms to non-Kubernetes workloads
- Implement NLP processing for blueprint creation through API integration
- Develop workload placement recommendation engine based on cost and performance metrics
- Build resource right-sizing system that analyzes usage patterns across all environments
- Design data collection pipeline to train ML models on customer-specific patterns

**Development Considerations:**

- Must determine whether ML processing happens in CloudBolt or StormForge backend
- Consider privacy implications of training across customer datasets
- Initial NLP capabilities may need to be limited to specific blueprint patterns
- Need testing framework to validate ML-generated recommendations
- Plan graceful fallbacks for when AI recommendations are low-confidence

## 3. Zero-Touch Release System

**Objective:** Implement Git-integrated configuration management for CloudBolt environments to enable version-controlled infrastructure.

**Technical Requirements:**

- Develop JSON/YAML serialization for all CloudBolt configuration items (blueprints, cloud states, RBAC rules)
- Create bidirectional sync API between CloudBolt and Git repositories
- Implement change detection system to track modifications
- Build deployment pipeline for pushing configurations to production environments
- Design conflict resolution mechanism for concurrent changes

**Development Considerations:**

- Security implications of storing configuration in external repositories
- Need standardized format that's both human-readable and machine-parseable
- Must handle credentials securely within configuration files
- Consider supporting multiple Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Performance implications of large configuration sets

## 4. Secret Management Integration

**Objective:** Develop integrations with external secret management platforms to improve security posture.

**Technical Requirements:**

- Build connector framework for external secret managers (Vault, CyberArc, Azure Key Vault)
- Implement just-in-time credential retrieval system
- Create credential caching mechanism with appropriate invalidation
- Develop error handling for secret retrieval failures
- Design monitoring for secret usage and access patterns

**Development Considerations:**

- Performance impact of external credential lookups
- Need for offline/fallback mode when secret managers are unreachable
- Handling of legacy systems that store credentials directly
- Migration path for existing credentials to external systems
- Compliance and audit logging requirements

## 5. Monitoring Integration Framework

**Objective:** Develop lightweight native monitoring with enterprise monitoring tool integration.

**Technical Requirements:**

- Implement Prometheus-based monitoring core for essential metrics
- Create connector APIs for Datadog, New Relic and other platforms
- Develop standardized metric translation layer between systems
- Build basic dashboard capabilities for common monitoring scenarios
- Design alerting integration with external systems

**Development Considerations:**

- Storage and retention policies for metrics data
- Performance impact of metrics collection on core system
- Handling of disconnected or intermittent monitoring
- Balance between native capabilities and external integrations
- Consider data volume implications at enterprise scale

## 6. Kubernetes Management Extensions

**Objective:** Integrate Helm chart support and enhance Kubernetes deployment capabilities.

**Technical Requirements:**

- Develop Helm chart repository integration similar to Terraform module handling
- Create templating system for Helm values customization
- Build governance and policy enforcement for Kubernetes deployments
- Implement integration with CI/CD systems like ArgoCD
- Enhance cluster lifecycle management across providers

**Development Considerations:**

- Handling of Helm chart versioning and updates
- Integration with StormForge optimization capabilities
- Security implications of Helm deployments
- Testing framework for Helm chart deployments
- User interface simplification while maintaining power user capabilities
