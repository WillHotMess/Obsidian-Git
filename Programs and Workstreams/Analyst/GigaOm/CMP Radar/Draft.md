By unifying the traditionally disparate processes of provisioning, management, and optimization, CloudBolt HCM helps organizations reduce operational complexity while giving technical teams the tools they need to deliver cloud services at scale.

### Product makeup

CloudBolt HCM is part of a larger cloud management portfolio that includes complementary solutions for cloud financial management (CloudBolt Cost & Security Management Platform). While these solutions can be implemented independently, they deliver the most value when deployed together.

The CloudBolt portfolio offers a modular yet integrated approach:

- **CloudBolt Hybrid Cloud Management (HCM)**: Our core solution for cloud automation, orchestration, and governance, delivered as a self-hosted virtual appliance.
    
- **CloudBolt Cost & Security Management Platform (CSMP)**: Our FinOps solution for multi-cloud cost optimization, delivered as a SaaS offering.
    

Each solution features its own specialized user interface optimized for specific user personas - from cloud administrators to financial stakeholders. However, the solutions share a common data model and integration framework that enables seamless communication between components.

The CloudBolt platform is built on a distributed architecture with a shared integration backplane, allowing for robust connectivity across the solution portfolio. This architecture enables organizations to adopt either CloudBolt HCM or CSMP individually to address specific pain points, or implement both solutions for comprehensive cloud lifecycle management.

CloudBolt solutions are designed to be self-managed by our customers, providing complete control over deployment and implementation. We do not operate a private network for solution delivery - rather, our platforms leverage your existing network infrastructure and security policies to ensure proper governance and compliance.
