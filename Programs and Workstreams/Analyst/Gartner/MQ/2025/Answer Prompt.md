# Business & GTM
#Prompt:

<We will be answering business and go-to-market (GTM) focused questions today. Please review each question and consider it in the context of the overall report goals outlined in the welcome packet.

The purpose of these questions is to ensure that we respond effectively. If my answer misses any part of the question, or if you require additional information to provide a more effective response, please feel free to caution, correct, or question me.

I will provide a question followed by a rough draft of a response. Your reply should directly answer the question first and then make a compelling case. You do not need to adhere to the provided draft; you can rearrange and reshape the response as necessary, as long as it remains true to the essence of the draft.
