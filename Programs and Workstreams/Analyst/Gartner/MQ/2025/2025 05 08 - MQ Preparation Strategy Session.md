## Agenda

- Review of last year's Magic Quadrant submission feedback
- Strategy for this year's questionnaire responses
- Briefing presentation structure and content
- Demo video preparation approach
- Timeline and next steps

## Discussion Notes

- **Previous MQ Submission Analysis**:
    
    - Responses need to highlight "better, best, unique" differentiators to score higher than "fully meets" (3/5)
    - Many answers focused on facts but didn't emphasize what makes CloudBolt special
    - Perceived weaknesses in statistical/forecasting capabilities and future-leaning functionality
    - Strong in "what was and what is" but not as strong in "what will be"
    - Gartner perceives CloudBolt as operations-oriented rather than financial management-focused
    - Some responses were repetitive across different segments and missed opportunities to show tailored approaches
- **2025 MQ Response Strategy**:
    
    - Create a Jira system to compare last year's responses with new submissions
    - Highlight what's new and differentiated in each response
    - Focus on addressing previous cautions, especially regarding CloudBolt's positioning in cloud financial management
    - Avoid cross-referencing between questions (analysts won't follow links)
    - Include customer examples to make answers concrete and credible
- **Demo Strategy**:
    
    - Create a storyboard template to map requirements to product features
    - Focus on showing differentiation rather than teaching functionality
    - Highlight the "better, best, unique" aspects rather than just meeting requirements
    - Avoid making it a "how-to" style demo
- **Briefing Presentation Approach**:
    
    - Emphasize CloudBolt's evolution in the cloud financial management space
    - Focus on what's new since last evaluation, particularly in advanced analytics and forecasting
    - Showcase customer metrics or case studies that demonstrate financial management capabilities
    - Address previous cautions head-on with evidence of progress
    - Highlight the StormForge acquisition as a strategic element
