- Timeline and next steps

## Discussion Notes

- **Previous MQ Submission Analysis**:
    
    - Responses need to highlight "better, best, unique" differentiators to score higher than "fully meets" (3/5)
    - Many answers focused on facts but didn't emphasize what makes CloudBolt special
    - Perceived weaknesses in statistical/forecasting capabilities and future-leaning functionality
    - Strong in "what was and what is" but not as strong in "what will be"
    - Gartner perceives CloudBolt as operations-oriented rather than financial management-focused
    - Some responses were repetitive across different segments and missed opportunities to show tailored approaches
- **2025 MQ Response Strategy**:
    
    - Create a Jira system to compare last year's responses with new submissions
    - Highlight what's new and differentiated in each response
    - Focus on addressing previous cautions, especially regarding CloudBolt's positioning in cloud financial management
    - Avoid cross-referencing between questions (analysts won't follow links)
    - Include customer examples to make answers concrete and credible
- **Demo Strategy**:
    
    - Create a storyboard template to map requirements to product features
    - Focus on showing differentiation rather than teaching functionality
    - Highlight the "better, best, unique" aspects rather than just meeting requirements
    - Avoid making it a "how-to" style demo
- **Briefing Presentation Approach**:
    
    - Emphasize CloudBolt's evolution in the cloud financial management space
    - Focus on what's new since last evaluation, particularly in advanced analytics and forecasting
    - Showcase customer metrics or case studies that demonstrate financial management capabilities
    - Address previous cautions head-on with evidence of progress
    - Highlight the StormForge acquisition as a strategic element

## PowerPoint Briefing Structure

Jeff outlined a specific approach for the upcoming 30-minute Gartner briefing presentation:

1. **Business Update** (1-2 slides)
    - Company metrics, growth, customer demographics
    - Business strategy and how it's operationalized
    - Dashboard with multiple charts showing trends and key metrics
    - Highlight hot sectors, growth, high renewal rates
2. **Market Success & Why We Win** (2-3 slides)
    - Win tracker with 15+ customer wins
    - For each win: customer, industry, use case, competitor, and why we won
    - Identify recurring themes in why customers choose CloudBolt
    - Present key differentiators and ideal customer profile
3. **Product & Architecture** (2-3 slides)
    - High-level architecture graphic showing how components work together
    - Explain how the architecture enables CloudBolt's advantages
    - Highlight key functional areas, especially new capabilities
    - Focus on the StormForge acquisition and its strategic importance
4. **Case Study** (1 slide)
    - Select a case study that demonstrates CloudBolt's value in cloud financial management
    - Show quantifiable results
    - Use as evidence of a key differentiator or value proposition
5. **Innovation & Investment** (2-3 slides)
    - List innovations delivered since last submission
    - Organize by investment themes (swim lanes)
    - For each innovation: capability name, customer value, availability date
    - Show structured, prioritized development roadmap (18 months)
6. **Addressing Previous Cautions** (1-2 slides)
    - New to cloud financial management market
    - Product geared toward technical users
    - Tagging capabilities
    - Address each with evidence of progress without "relitigating the past"
7. **Summary** (1 slide)
    - Business growth, customer set growth, product growth
    - Strong innovation investment
    - Leave on screen during Q&A as a "commercial"

Key presentation advice:

- Make slides more detailed than typical presentations so they can stand alone as reference material
- Ensure all slides are skimmable but contain enough information
- Focus on getting through to the roadmap and addressing cautions sections
- Be prepared for questions about CEO change but don't proactively bring it up
