## Summary

Strategic planning meeting focused on completing Gartner Magic Quadrant questionnaire responses and preparing demo briefing videos. Discussion centered on highlighting competitive differentiation, managing resource constraints, and executing within tight timelines while maintaining quality standards for analyst evaluation.

## Agenda

- Gartner questionnaire completion strategy and quality review
- Competitive differentiation and positioning in responses
- Demo and briefing video production planning
- Resource allocation and timeline management
- Production workflow and deliverable requirements

## Discussion Notes

**Questionnaire Strategy & Differentiation:**

- Jeff emphasized the importance of highlighting differentiating factors in questionnaire responses, particularly areas where CloudBolt excels compared to competitors
- Responses should follow structure: summary statement + evidence + proof, avoiding assertions without backing
- Need to identify 20 out of 200 questions that can "move the needle" by showcasing core differentiators
- William noted some team members lack competitive awareness, creating gaps in comparative responses

**Resource Constraints & Timeline Pressure:**

- Approximately 100 questions remain outstanding in the questionnaire
- Kyle (key team member) unavailable due to client obligations
- William plans to complete draft responses during 7-hour flight to San Diego conference
- Multiple competing priorities including two major conferences and town hall meeting
- Limited team availability with same key people (Kyle, Will, Charles, Yasmin) needed for all tasks

**Demo & Briefing Video Requirements:**

- 70 minutes total video content divided into 7 use cases (10 minutes each)
- First-time requirement from Gartner for this type of vendor briefing format
- Structure per use case: thesis, differentiation points, customer examples, product demonstration
- Videos need table of contents with timecodes and breadcrumb navigation
- Jeff recommended 70% slides, 30% product demonstration to make content "real"

**Production Workflow Challenges:**

- Planned approach: transcript session with Kyle → AI-assisted slide creation → recording → editing
- Limited to 4 hours of working time for slide preparation
- Charles (video editor) needed for splicing and production over weekend
- Delivery deadline: Monday morning following weekend production
- On-site demo recording required during conference week

**Quality vs. Speed Trade-offs:**

- Jeff advocated for completing one use case fully before proceeding to ensure approach works
- William prioritized completing all seven simultaneously due to time constraints
- Agreed to focus on core messaging: "Here's our approach, here's what we do, here's the evidence, here's where it lives in the product"
- Accepted that some repetition across videos is acceptable given format (7 separate 10-minute segments)

## Action Items

- [ ] **William Norton**: Complete questionnaire draft responses during flight to San Diego (Sunday, 7-hour transit)
- [ ] **William Norton**: Upload all responses to Gartner Portal during travel
- [ ] **William Norton**: Review all questions with Kyle on Monday at conference location
- [ ] **Jeff Comport**: Assign questions requiring competitive differentiation back to William for revision
- [ ] **Jeff Comport**: Push back on inadequate responses and flag for "input needed" status
- [ ] **Team**: Conduct virtual briefing transcript session (Friday) to develop content for each use case
- [ ] **William Norton**: Structure and record 70-minute briefing video (Friday afternoon)
- [ ] **Charles**: Edit and splice briefing video content over weekend for Monday delivery
- [ ] **Team**: Record demo videos on-site during conference week
- [ ] **Jeff Comport**: Review PowerPoint presentation Friday morning before recording session

## Follow-up

- **Next meeting date**: Virtual briefing transcript session scheduled for Friday
- **Key deadline**: Monday morning - all materials must be submitted to Gartner
- **Conference obligations**: FinOps X conference runs concurrent with preparation timeline
- **Additional resources**: Demo prep spreadsheet tool available in shared directory for tracking progress
- **Critical path**: Questionnaire completion → briefing video production → demo recording → final submission

**Risk factors noted**: Limited team availability, competing conference obligations, compressed timeline requiring weekend work, dependency on key personnel (Kyle, Charles) for multiple deliverables.
