Does your CFM offering support the execution of recommended actions from within your solution?


---

Does your CFM offering support automating the execution of recommended actions? (Answer YES only if the automation engine is natively built into your solution.) 


Does your CFM offering support the implementation of scheduled actions on target cloud resources? (Scheduled actions may include tasks such as turning virtual machines on or off and adjusting the storage performance tier.)

Does your CFM offering support automatically stopping resources by detecting their idle/unused state using external metrics? (This capability involves automatically identifying when a system is idle by monitoring external metrics like network traffic or load balancer activity. For instance, if a virtual machine shows no network traffic over a certain period, it is likely unused and can be stopped. Unlike scheduling, this functionality does not rely on internal metrics such as CPU or memory usage, nor does it require the user to set up a scheduling window.) 

Does your CFM offering manage the workflow for remediation actions? (A remediation workflow oversees the progression of cost-related actions, coordinating among multiple stakeholders through the stages of detection, notification, validation, execution, or dismissal of a budget violation or optimization opportunity. Answer YES only if your solution handles this workflow natively, without relying on third-party integrations.)

Does your CFM offering integrate with workflow management systems to manage the remediation workflow? (Answer YES only if you offer this integration out-of-the-box, without the need for customers to write code or use your API. Integrations that are only possible through your SDK or API do not qualify for this question. Common external workflow management systems used for this purpose include ServiceNow and Jira Software.)
