# CloudBolt Acquires StormForge: Transforming Kubernetes Optimization

Today marks a significant milestone in CloudBolt's journey as we proudly announce the acquisition of StormForge, our long-standing technical partner and a pioneer in machine learning-powered Kubernetes optimization.

Having personally consulted with enterprises on reducing cloud cost waste, I've witnessed firsthand the delicate balance teams face: optimizing complex clustered environments without compromising application performance. This challenging balancing act often leads organizations to avoid optimizing their containerized Kubernetes environments altogether. This challenge demands a better solution.

StormForge's ML technology automatically optimizes resource allocation in real time, reducing waste while maintaining performanceâ€”all without requiring specialized knowledge or constant attention from engineering teams.

By integrating StormForge into CloudBolt's FinOps platform, we're creating a powerful solution for Kubernetes cost management that brings transparency and efficiency to container environments.

The StormForge team consists of exceptionally talented professionals, and we're thrilled to welcome them to the CloudBolt family.

If you're facing Kubernetes cost challenges, I'd be happy to discuss how our combined solution can help.
