Here is the launch plan for storm forge on Tuesday March 31st: at 9:00 AM the news will hit the wire and the press release will be available shortly after we will adapt that to our website and create both a press release on the cloudbolt website and on the storm forge website. After that Joanne is going to send the CloudBolt customer comms as well as both StormForge and CloudBolt marketing list comms. CloudBolt communications will happen through HubSpot and storm forge communications will happen via pardot. The cloud will communication for the marketing audience will feature a middle of funnel call to action for downloading the solution brief and a bottom of funnel call to action for signing up for a free trial. Frank and the team to decide on the call to action for the customer communications on the cloud bolt side. 
After that Joanne is going to send out a LinkedIn post to a microsite on both LinkedIn profiles the microsite will be set up on cloud bolts website and will feature the press release the Craig and John Platt video the launch day blog and other resources such as the solution guide. The storm forge LinkedIn page will have a new banner and we'll have directs to the cloud vault LinkedIn page. We will also update all other storm forge social profiles (blueksy, X, etc) announcing that cloud bolt has acquired the company with direct links to our site.
