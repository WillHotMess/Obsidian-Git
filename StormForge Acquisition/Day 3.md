[StormForge+AWS GTM 2025.pdf](attachment:51c2b1c9-20ef-436d-adf4-a2a9a2650b13:StormForgeAWS_GTM_2025.pdf)

## Key Partnership Status Details

- **AWS Tier Level**: StormForge achieved "differentiated partner" status in Q4 2024, which is the highest tier possible for an ISV partner
- **EKS Ready Designation**: StormForge received this important certification in Q4 2024, allowing them to be invited to roadmap discussions and priority go-to-market initiatives
- **Unique Market Position**: StormForge is the only pod right-sizing tool available as an EKS add-on (only one of two cost optimization tools total)

## AWS Recognition & Advocacy

- **Specialist Advocacy**: AWS specialists and product leadership actively recommend StormForge when asked about pod right-sizing
- **Executive Recognition**: According to Yasmin, "People at AWS tell us for a company your size, you have an outsized impact inside"
- **Internal Champions**: Significant internal recognition at AWS with specialists mentioning StormForge during breakout sessions at reInvent

## Global Expansion Infrastructure

- **Brazil Distribution Agreement**: Established to help customers avoid 30% software import taxes on deals over $250K
- **EMEA Distribution Agreement**: Makes AWS the seller of record for marketplace transactions across EMEA to handle VAT tax collection

## Marketing & Content Details

- **Content Challenges**: AWS shut down their blog to partner contributions around reInvent last year
- **Workshop Infrastructure**: AWS provides all workshop studio environments, eliminating StormForge's need to maintain infrastructure for prospect workshops
- **Partner-Led Wind Wires**: Create confidential deal win summaries that are distributed to AWS to demonstrate success patterns

## Financial & Administrative Information

- **Payment Improvements**: AWS disbursement now occurs the next business day after payment collection (previously took 9 days)
- **Marketplace Fees**: 3% listing fee on new deals, 1% on renewals
- **MDF Status**: Currently ad-hoc through the Global Startup Partners program (no cohesive annual plan)

## Technical Integration Challenges

- **EKS Add-On UX**: Described as "one of the worst experiences" requiring users to flip between two different interfaces
- **AutoMode Implementation**: Team is working to implement AutoMode internally to qualify for case study status

## CloudBolt Synergy Opportunities

- Both teams identified significant opportunities to share responsibilities and adopt best practices from each other's AWS relationship management approaches
- CloudBolt recently joined ISV Accelerate (in onboarding) and should consider a public announcement soon

## Digital, Brand, Wed

## 1. Acquisition Announcement & KubeCon (April 1st)

- **Critical timing**: Acquisition announcement coincides with KubeCon, offering immediate marketing opportunity
- **Booth presence**: StormForge has an 8x8 booth that will need co-branded materials or announcement highlights
- **Visual assets**: Need for slideshow content and potential video announcing the acquisition
- **Promotional gap**: QR code on AWS t-shirts/swag points to unfinished promo page (stormforgeio/aws-promo)

## 2. Marketing Campaigns & Lead Generation

- **AWS-funded campaign**: "Technology Advice" agency creating video, white paper, and email nurture sequence
- **Lead volume**: Campaign has generated 250 leads but lacks nurture strategy for conversion
- **Content sponsorships**: Ongoing relationships with "Learn K8S" and "The Cube" for targeted content distribution
- **Event strategy**: Multiple Kubernetes Community Days (KCDs) in Brazil, Austin, NY, and SF (NY is only one with lead gen)

## 3. Content Development Challenges

- **Technical knowledge barrier**: Significant difficulties finding contractors with sufficient Kubernetes expertise
- **Internal bottlenecks**: SMEs prioritize product development over marketing content contributions
- **Key relationship**: "Inbound Squared" (Bob) creates SEO-driven technical content at reduced rate during transition
- **Content quality issues**: Technical inaccuracies in contractor-developed content requiring extensive internal review

## 4. Website Infrastructure & Migration Planning

- **CMS platform**: Using Craft CMS (not WordPress) with highly granular permissions system
- **Hosting arrangement**: Website fully managed by agency including hosting (unlike CloudBolt's setup)
- **Migration approach**: Plan to identify highest-traffic content (20/80 rule) for prioritized migration with 301 redirects
- **SEO preservation**: Careful management needed to avoid Google penalties during migration

## 5. Subject Matter Expert Dynamics

- **Resource constraints**: Engineering priorities consistently override marketing content development
- **Technical review process**: Significant delays getting technical accuracy verification for content
- **Relationship management**: Different approaches needed for different SMEs based on working preferences

## 6. Tools & Analytics Infrastructure

- **Dashboards**: Custom Looker dashboards for AdWords and traffic segmentation by source
- **Content planning**: Asana boards for content ideas and roadmapping
- **Asset management**: Most marketing assets in Google Drive, organized by initiative
- **Video hosting**: YouTube channel contains most video content (some private)

## 7. AWS Relationship Management

- **Co-authored content**: Blog about Total Cost of Ownership with AWS EKS auto mode content in progress
- **Funding requirements**: MDF allocation being managed by Erwin
- **Promotional limitations**: AWS blog contributions no longer permitted due to policy change
- **Alternative approach**: Working toward case study status by implementing AutoMode internally
