# StormForge Acquisition Week 1 Performance Summary (3/31-4/4)

**Subject:** StormForge Acquisition - Week 1 Performance Summary

Dear Team,

I'm pleased to share our first week results following the StormForge acquisition announcement on March 31st. Early results indicate strong market reception across all channels, with notable media coverage, significant website traffic increases, and healthy engagement metrics.

## Executive Summary

The acquisition announcement has exceeded expectations in several key areas:
- **Media Reception**: 8 high-value media placements including Forbes and Axios, with 887 full text placements reaching a potential audience of 246.9 million 
- **Website Impact**: 2,210 unique visitors to our acquisition hub (more than double our typical daily traffic, site-wide)
- **Engagement Activity**: 165 high-value actions including 97 demo page visits and 52 StormForge free trial clicks*
	- **Note on Data Limitations:** We currently cannot accurately track Free Trial engagements (a primary CTA) until we complete the SFDC integration in mid-April. 
	- As a workaround, I'm exploring using Segment data to correlate sign-ups and installations, and will work with Nick and Yasmin to establish interim tracking.
- **Social Performance**: 49 new followers and 11,146 impressions with a 3.61% CTR (significantly above B2B benchmarks) 
- **Email Performance**: Customer communications achieved 6.7% open rate with strong 4.82% clickthrough rate
- **Customer Sentiment**: I'll be collaborating with Frank and the SE team next week to capture early customer sentiment about the acquisition, providing qualitative context to complement our performance metrics.

## Looking Ahead
Over the next week, we will:
1. Continue monitoring additional media coverage and pursue interview opportunities
2. Launch follow-up nurture campaigns to engaged Free Trial contacts
3. Optimize advertising spend based on initial performance data
4. Prepare for additional content and social campaigns

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like additional details on any aspect of our performance.
