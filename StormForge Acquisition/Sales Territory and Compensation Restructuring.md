# Sales Territory and Compensation Restructuring Summary

This plan outlines the territory assignments, compensation structure, and role changes for the sales organization, with a focus on integrating StormForge (SF) and CloudBolt (CB) operations.

## Territory and Quota Allocations

- **Josh (New Seller)**: Will manage the Western territory starting Q2, with a 9-month CloudBolt quota.

## Transitional Credit Structure

- **Q2**: Josh receives 2/3 credit for pre-existing StormForge deals outside his territory, collaborating with landing sellers.
- **Q3**: Josh receives 1/3 credit for pre-existing StormForge deals outside his territory, with landing sellers taking the lead.
- **Q4**: Josh focuses exclusively on his assigned territory with no external deal credits.

## Lead Distribution

- Beginning April 1, new StormForge leads will be assigned to territory-specific sellers.
- All leads will receive support from Yasmin, John P, or Shane (SE).
- Distribution methodology will be consistent across all leads.

## Role Adjustments

- **Shishir**: Partner-focused role building pipeline, requiring an incentive compensation plan based on 85% revenue and 15% new pipeline for regional sellers. Primary focus on Ingram, DXC, and Hitachi partnerships.
- **Erwin**: Will support Shishir and Nick, taking responsibility for AWS enablement, marketplaces, and processes across all products. May assist with Ingram Marketplaces. Compensation structure pending guidance from StormForge team.

## Additional Initiatives

- **Cross-Selling**: StormForge to existing CloudBolt customers (ownership between Frank's team and sales team to be determined).
- **Enablement**: Yasmin and John P will participate in sales enablement meetings focusing on StormForge pitch and qualification processes. Yasmin plans to attend the QBR in Chicago on the 23rd and 24th.
