# Marketing Operations Integration Between Companies

This meeting transcript covers discussions between Yasmin, Nick Macaione, and other team members (including Lindsey from StormForge Marketing) regarding the integration of marketing and sales operations systems following what appears to be an acquisition or merger.

## Key Discussion Points:

### Lead Management Process

- The current system uses Segment to track user signups and installations
- When a user signs up, alerts are sent to Slack and Salesforce
- A rocket ship emoji in Slack indicates when a user actually installs the software
- The team distinguishes between "signups" (potentially including spam) and "installs" (qualified leads)
- Issues with the current system include occasional failures in reporting installs

### Tech Stack Integration

- StormForge uses Salesforce, Pardot, and Segment
- CloudBolt appears to use HubSpot as their primary marketing automation platform
- Nick plans to migrate relevant data from Salesforce to HubSpot
- Team discussed maintaining overlapping licenses during transition
- Segment integration will need to be evaluated for continued use or replacement

### Forms and Website Considerations

- Multiple forms exist on the StormForge website: contact sales, contact support, partner application, Java beta signup, and SOC 2 report requests
- Some legacy forms still receive occasional submissions
- Discussed potential simplification by redirecting forms to CloudBolt equivalents
- Website uses Craft CMS (migrated from WordPress previously)

### Reporting and Analytics

- The team reviews a free trial dashboard that tracks signups and installations
- Data is categorized by status: active, expired, and never installed
- Changes to the trial process in December 2023 affected how data is tracked
- Weekly meetings are held to review numbers and discuss follow-up with trial users
- There's a challenge with converting leads to contacts in Salesforce due to existing reporting dependencies

### Next Steps

- Nick will get access to Pardot and Salesforce to explore further
- Integration priorities include ensuring HubSpot connection before changing Salesforce
- The team will need to coordinate with Olivia on system access

The meeting highlighted the complexities of merging marketing operations systems and the need for careful planning to maintain reporting continuity and lead management processes during the transition.
