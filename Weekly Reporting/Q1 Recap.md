**Report Date: April 4, 2025**
As of April 4, 2025, we have achieved strong year-to-date performance across all key pipeline metrics, with mixed results against Q1 targets but solid positioning against annual goals. 

For Net New Business, we've generated:
- **120 MQLs** 
- **72 SALs** 
- **31 SQLs** 
- **34 Opportunities** 
- **$2.83M in pipeline value** 
- We maintain an outstanding pipeline of **$7.8M** across 84 open opportunities

## YTD Performance Against Annual Targets

|Metric|YTD Total|Annual Target|% of Annual Target Complete|Q1 Target|Q1 Actual|% to Q1 Target|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|MQLs|120|405|29.6%|101|113|112%|
|SALs|72|381|18.9%|95|70|74%|
|SQLs|31|99|31.3%|25|30|120%|
|Opportunities|34|75|45.3%|19|32|168%|
|Pipeline Value|$2.83M|$8.25M|34.3%|$2.06M|$2.80M|136%|

Our annual and quarterly targets are based on the following assumptions:
1. **Revenue Model Assumptions**:
    - Average Sales Price (ASP): $110,000 per opportunity
    - Opportunity win rate: 15%
    - Annual **New Business** pipeline goal: $8,246,101
    - Quarterly **New Business** pipeline goal: $2,061,525
2. **Funnel Conversion Assumptions**:
    - MQL to SAL conversion: 94%
    - SAL to SQL conversion: 26%
    - SQL to Opportunity conversion: 76%
3. **Target Calculation Methodology**:
    - Starting with required annual pipeline value ($8.25M)
    - Divided by ASP ($110,000) to determine required won deals (75)
    - Applied win rate (15%) to determine required opportunities (75)
    - Applied conversion rates at each funnel stage to determine required SQLs (99), SALs (381), and MQLs (405)
    - Quarterly targets represent annual targets divided by four

## Q1 2025 Performance Analysis

Our Q1 performance demonstrates effective pipeline development with notable strengths:

1. **MQL Generation**: Generated 113 MQLs, achieving 112% of the quarterly target, indicating strong top-of-funnel activity.
    
2. **SQL and Opportunity Conversion**: Significantly exceeded targets for both SQLs (120%) and Opportunities (168%), demonstrating efficient conversion through the lower funnel.
    
3. **Pipeline Value Creation**: Generated $2.80M in pipeline value against a $2.06M target (136%), positioning us well for the fiscal year.
    
4. **SAL Performance**: This remains our primary area for improvement, with 70 SALs generated against a target of 95 (74%).
    

## Q2 Initial Performance (Week 1)

The first week of Q2 shows the expected modest start to a new quarter:

- 7 MQLs (6.9% of quarterly target)
- 1 SAL (1.1% of quarterly target)
- 1 SQL (4.0% of quarterly target)
- 2 New Opportunities (10.5% of quarterly target)
- $0 new pipeline created this quarter to date

These metrics align with typical beginning-of-quarter patterns, and we maintain a substantial outstanding pipeline of **$7.8M** across 84 open opportunities.

## Goal-Setting Assumptions and Methodology

Our annual and quarterly targets are based on the following assumptions:

1. **Revenue Model Assumptions**:
    - Average Sales Price (ASP): $110,000 per opportunity
    - Opportunity win rate: 15%
    - Annual **New Business** pipeline** goal: $8,246,101
    - Quarterly **New Business** pipeline goal: $2,061,525
2. **Funnel Conversion Assumptions**:
    - MQL to SAL conversion: 94%
    - SAL to SQL conversion: 26%
    - SQL to Opportunity conversion: 76%
3. **Target Calculation Methodology**:
    - Starting with required annual pipeline value ($8.25M)
    - Divided by ASP ($110,000) to determine required won deals (75)
    - Applied win rate (15%) to determine required opportunities (75)
    - Applied conversion rates at each funnel stage to determine required SQLs (99), SALs (381), and MQLs (405)
    - Quarterly targets represent annual targets divided by four

These assumptions will be reviewed quarterly based on actual performance data to ensure appropriate target-setting going forward.

## Conclusion and Forward Outlook

Based on our Q1 performance, we are well-positioned to meet or exceed our annual pipeline targets. Our strength in opportunity generation and conversion efficiency compensates for the identified gap in SAL conversion.

For Q2, we will focus on:

1. Implementing targeted programs to improve SAL conversion rates
2. Maintaining our strong opportunity conversion efficiency
3. Ensuring consistent progression of the substantial existing pipeline value

We anticipate continued strong performance through Q2, with potential upside if SAL conversion improvements can be realized.
