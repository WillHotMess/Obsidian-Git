Subject: Q2 Marketing Pipeline Update - Week 1

Gents,

I'm sharing our first pipeline update for Q2. 

Let me know if you'd like to discuss strategies to accelerate Q2 outstanding pipeline.

**----**

**Pipeline Highlights**

In the first week of Q2, we have generated **7 MQLs** (6% to budget), **1 SAL** (1% to budget), **1 SQL** (3% to budget), and **2 New Opportunities** (9% to budget), with **$0 new pipeline** created this quarter.

Current pipeline status:
- 84 Total Open Opportunities
- $7.8M in outstanding Pipeline value
- The average age for open opportunities approximately 185 days (about 6 months).
- **64.3% of opportunities (54)** are older than 90 days, representing $5.72M in pipeline value

Our focus should be both on progressing older opportunities and cleaning up our pipeline.

**----**

**A Note on Activity Not Being Captured**:

- 56 out of 84 opportunities (67%) show recent activity in their Next Steps comments
- 45 opportunities actually show April 2025 activity dates in the notes
- This confirms that the team is actively working many deals that appear stale in the system



Regards,

[Your Name]
