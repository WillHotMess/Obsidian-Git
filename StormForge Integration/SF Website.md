# Complete Kubernetes Optimization: CloudBolt + StormForge

## Closing the FinOps Loop with ML-Powered Kubernetes Optimization

CloudBolt Software, The Cloud ROI Company™, has acquired StormForge, the pioneer in machine learning-powered Kubernetes resource optimization, creating the most comprehensive solution for enterprise Kubernetes cost management available today.

## The Challenge: Kubernetes Cost Management

As Kubernetes adoption skyrockets, so do the challenges:

- **49%** of organizations report Kubernetes has driven up cloud spend
- **70%** cite overspend directly related to workload overprovisioning
- The dynamic nature of containers makes proper resource allocation extremely difficult
- Complexity of Kubernetes environments obscures granular cost visibility

## Introducing the Complete Solution

By combining CloudBolt's award-winning FinOps platform with StormForge's machine learning technology, we deliver a closed-loop system for Kubernetes cost optimization that enables you to:

### 🔍 INFORM

- Gain unprecedented visibility into Kubernetes spending
- Break open the "black box" of container costs
- Track spending across clusters, namespaces, and workloads

### 🔄 OPTIMIZE

- Apply ML-driven recommendations for resource settings
- Automatically adjust resource requests and limits in real-time
- Reduce cloud costs by 50-70% without performance risks

### ⚙️ OPERATE

- Maintain continuous optimization as traffic patterns change
- Eliminate the need for specialized Kubernetes knowledge
- Free developers from manual tuning to focus on innovation

## Key Features

### Intelligent Resource Rightsizing
Automatically optimize CPU and memory settings based on actual usage patterns, eliminating waste while ensuring performance.

### Bidimensional Autoscaling
Uniquely combine vertical pod autoscaling with horizontal pod autoscaling for optimization on multiple dimensions.

### Enterprise-Scale Automation
Deploy hands-free lifecycle automation across your entire Kubernetes estate with minimal manual intervention.

### Engineer-Friendly Approach
Respect engineering decisions with transparent, configurable optimization that works within boundaries you define.

### Comprehensive Visibility
Track your Kubernetes costs with detailed breakdowns across workloads, namespaces, and allocation groups.

### Closed-Loop Optimization
Move seamlessly from insight to action with an integrated platform that both identifies opportunities and implements optimizations.

## Transformative Results
### Customer Success Stories

> **US Bank**  
> "StormForge has added immediate gains by overall net-capacity savings due to overprovisioned workloads... Had we implemented StormForge earlier on, we would have prevented several performance related outages due to unaccounted growth and utilization. Furthermore, the overall net savings on capacity has given us tremendous cost savings."
> 
> _— Mark Piersak, Vice President of Container Platform Solutions_

> **Acquia**  
> "Within the first six months of deploying Optimize Live — if not sooner — we achieved the ROI that we wanted to achieve, and we have continued to optimize that over time."
> 
> _— Ed Brennan, Chief Software Architect_

## Simple Implementation

1. **Connect** - Deploy a lightweight, read-only agent that will analyze your clusters

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is this different from other Kubernetes optimization solutions?**  
A: Unlike manual approaches that require specialized knowledge and constant attention, our combined solution automatically adjusts resource requests and limits to match real-time demand, eliminating the risk of performance issues while consistently reducing cost waste across all Kubernetes deployments.

**Q: How quickly can I expect to see results?**  
A: Most customers begin seeing optimization recommendations within the first week of deployment, with measurable cost savings typically realized within the first month.

**Q: Will this affect the performance of my applications?**  
A: No. Our solution is designed to optimize resources without compromising performance. The machine learning engine works within boundaries you define to ensure applications have the resources they need for reliable, high-performance operation.

**Q: How does the integration with existing tools work?**  
A: As a Technical Alliance Program (TAP) partner, StormForge is already integrated into the CloudBolt Platform. The solution works seamlessly with your existing Kubernetes technologies like the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and node management tools like Karpenter.

**Q: Is this solution cloud-specific?**  
A: No. The combined platform is cloud and distribution agnostic, running anywhere Kubernetes is deployed, including all major cloud platforms.
