## Coaching Feedback: Consultative Leadership in Action

Based on your recent transcripts, here’s a detailed assessment of your consultative approach as a VP of Marketing, highlighting what you’re doing well and where you can focus to further strengthen your consultative leadership style.

**What You’re Doing Well**

- **Facilitating Alignment and Clarity**
    
    - You consistently bring the team back to the big picture, ensuring alignment on priorities, resource allocation, and expectations. For example, you advocate for revisiting go-to-market alignment at the leadership level and clarifying what’s expected from marketing versus what’s actually possible with current resources2.
        
    - You’re proactive in surfacing potential misalignments early, such as the risk of over-rotating on StormForge at the expense of other priorities, and you suggest concrete steps (e.g., XCOM breakout, mapping resource allocation) to address these issues2.
        
- **Encouraging Open Dialogue and Cross-Functional Collaboration**
    
    - Your tone is approachable and you invite input from others, often asking clarifying questions and validating others’ perspectives. This helps foster a collaborative environment where team members feel comfortable raising concerns and sharing ideas12.
        
    - You highlight the interconnectedness of marketing activities with other functions (sales, product, partnerships), ensuring that handoffs and dependencies are acknowledged and managed2.
        
- **Structured Problem-Solving and Process Orientation**
    
    - You break down complex projects into actionable steps, such as mapping out nurture flows, segmenting campaign lists, and clarifying ownership of tasks. This helps the team move from ambiguity to action1.
        
    - You’re methodical in documenting processes, sharing recaps, and ensuring that knowledge is transferred and accessible (e.g., transition docs, Slack channels, Asana tasks)1.
        
- **Balancing Strategic and Tactical Perspectives**
    
    - You keep the team focused on both immediate deliverables and longer-term strategic goals, such as integrating StormForge into the broader platform and planning for major events like KubeCon and FinOpsX1.
        
    - You’re realistic about what can be achieved, pushing back on “nice to haves” when necessary and helping the team prioritize based on impact and available resources12.
        
- **Consultative Communication Style**
    
    - You ask thoughtful, open-ended questions to draw out expertise from others (e.g., “What are you seeing in terms of ROI?” “How do we want to handle this handoff?”), which is a hallmark of a consultative approach1.
        
    - You validate and synthesize input, often summarizing discussions and proposing next steps, which helps drive consensus and shared understanding1.
        

**Areas to Focus On for Even Greater Consultative Impact**

- **Drive Even More Stakeholder Engagement Upstream**
    
    - While you’re excellent at surfacing issues and proposing solutions, consider more actively engaging senior stakeholders (e.g., XCOM, product leadership) in setting and communicating clear, company-wide priorities. This can help reduce ambiguity and prevent misaligned expectations from trickling down2.
        
    - Proactively facilitate sessions where cross-functional leaders can debate and agree on trade-offs, rather than letting priorities be set by inertia or the “loudest voice.”
        
- **Clarify and Communicate Decision-Making Frameworks**
    
    - As you help the team prioritize, consider formalizing frameworks for decision-making (e.g., impact vs. effort matrices, RACI charts for ownership). This can help depersonalize tough calls and make it easier to say “no” to low-priority asks2.
        
    - Share these frameworks broadly so everyone understands how and why decisions are made, reducing the risk of miscommunication or frustration.
        
- **Empower and Coach Others to Be Consultative**
    
    - You model consultative behavior well; consider coaching your direct reports and peers to do the same. For example, encourage them to ask clarifying questions, seek input from other functions, and document their reasoning for key decisions.
        
    - Create opportunities for others to lead discussions or facilitate alignment sessions, building consultative muscle across the team.
        
- **Anticipate and Manage Change Fatigue**
    
    - The team is navigating significant change (acquisition, integration, shifting priorities). Acknowledge this openly and create space for the team to surface concerns or confusion. Regular check-ins and retrospectives can help maintain morale and ensure everyone feels heard2.
        
    - Be explicit about what’s changing, what’s staying the same, and why—especially as you sunset legacy motions or introduce new processes.
        
- **Continue to Champion Customer-Centricity**
    
    - You do a good job of connecting marketing activities to business outcomes (e.g., lead quality, event ROI). Continue to push for a deep understanding of customer needs and pain points, and ensure that all marketing and go-to-market motions are grounded in delivering value to the customer1.
        
    - Encourage the team to bring customer insights into planning discussions, and use these insights to challenge assumptions or redirect efforts as needed.

## Sample Consultative Moves to Try

- **“Let’s map out all current asks and stack-rank them by business impact and resource requirement. Who should be in the room to make these calls?”**
    
- **“What are the key outcomes we want from this integration, and how will we measure success? Let’s align on these before we commit to new initiatives.”**
    
- **“I’d like to hear from each function—what’s one thing you need from marketing to be successful this quarter, and what’s one thing you can deprioritize?”**
    
- **“How can we make our decision-making process more transparent, so everyone understands why we’re focusing on X and not Y?”**
    

## Final Thoughts

You’re already demonstrating many of the hallmarks of a consultative leader: you listen, synthesize, facilitate alignment, and drive action. By further formalizing your approach to prioritization, decision-making, and stakeholder engagement—and by empowering others to adopt a consultative mindset—you’ll amplify your impact both internally and externally. Keep leaning into your strengths, and use these focus areas as levers for even greater influence and effectiveness.
