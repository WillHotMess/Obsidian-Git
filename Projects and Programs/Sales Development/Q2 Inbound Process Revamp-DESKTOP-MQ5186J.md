- We have adapted Caleb's comp structure based on the guidance that the field will be taking a lead role in the inbound process. 
	- So, our expectation that AEs will be leading this at scale. 
	- Which is an adaptation of our current state. 
- What are your expectations on first call availability? 
	- What is the farthest time that you consider acceptable 


**Questions for meeting w/ Steve regarding IB's:**  
1. How will the meetings be scheduled?
    1. Does chilipiper come to me and I reach out to AE's to add them to the meetings?
    2. Or CP for both AE and myself?
2. What happens if AE can't join?
    1. Do I reschedule?
    2. What's the time frame for rescheduling?
    3. If other AE is requested who should I work reschedule with?
    4. Whoever is available at that time? That would be a risk of finding good time (would be good to ensure buy-in from client prior to AE meet)
3. What is my role in this call?
    1. Just quick introduction of AE and pass off all disco to AE?
    2. Or is there an intro q I should ask to get the convo rolling?
4. Should I handle scheduling of next steps?
