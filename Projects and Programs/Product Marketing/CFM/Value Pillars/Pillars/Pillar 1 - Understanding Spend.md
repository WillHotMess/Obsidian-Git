## Market Problem:

The cloud landscape has fundamentally shifted from simple public vs. private decisions to an intricate mesh of deployment options – from traditional IaaS to modern PaaS and SaaS services. This complexity isn't just a trend; it's the new operating reality.

## Business Evolution:

Organizations aren't just adopting multiple clouds; they're strategically embracing a cloud fabric approach that prioritizes workload flexibility and deployment optionality. We're seeing our customers move beyond 'cloud-first' to 'cloud-right' thinking.

## Hurdles & Challenges:

The exponential growth in cloud data sources has created a perfect storm for IT leaders. They're drowning in disparate cost and usage data while their teams waste countless hours on manual reconciliation and reporting. Traditional tools simply weren't built for this level of complexity.

## Business Risk Exposure:

When organizations lack unified visibility across their cloud fabric, they're essentially flying blind. This fragmented approach leads to financial inefficiency and, more concerning, strategic decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate data. The cost of inaction compounds daily.

## Value Proposition Statement:

With FOCUS-ready support for any cloud environment - from public and private clouds to PaaS and SaaS - you can ensure every stakeholder has the insights they need to make confident and informed business decisions.

## Proof Points:

- 100% multi-cloud cost visibility within hours of deployment
    
- Drive unallocated spend to 0%
    
- Provide every stakeholder with a total-cost-of-ownership in the cloud
