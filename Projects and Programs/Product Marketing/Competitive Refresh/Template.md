## The New FinOps Imperative
The days of simple cloud cost visibility are over. According to the 2025 State of FinOps report, 65% of organizations now manage SaaS spend through their FinOps practices, 49% are tackling licensing costs, and 63% are grappling with rapidly growing AI investments across multiple environments. Yet most FinOps tools remain stuck in the past – focused solely on public cloud IaaS with limited automation capabilities.

**The result?** FinOps teams are drowning. The average practitioner is attempting to increase effort across 12 different capabilities while taking on more scope. This unsustainable approach explains why 50% still cite workload optimization as their top priority year after year – they simply can't make meaningful progress.

At CloudBolt our vision is to address these critical challenges once and for all.

## The Choice Is Clear
CloudBolt is fundamentally reimagining cloud financial management through three market-changing innovations:

### 1. True Multi-Cloud Fabric Visibility
Legacy tools claim "multi-cloud" but only deliver fragmented views across public providers. With our FOCUS-ready data platform and the CloudBolt agent, CloudBolt provides unified visibility and control across your entire compute fabric – public, private, SaaS, and Kubernetes. 
### 2. Automation That Closes the Gap
The State of FinOps reveals that 33% of optimization recommendations go unimplemented due to competing engineering priorities. The CloudBolt platform transforms manual processes into continuous, automated workflows, reducing insight-to-action lead time from weeks to minutes – finally addressing what 53% of respondents cite as their critical need for better automation.
### 3. Open Ecosystem vs. Closed Platforms
While competitors force you into rigid platforms, our Technology Alliance Program (TAP) enables you to build your ideal FinOps toolkit with specialized capabilities for Kubernetes, SaaS management, commitment optimization, and more.
