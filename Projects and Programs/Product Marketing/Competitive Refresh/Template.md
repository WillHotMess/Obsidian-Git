# Is Your FinOps Solution Ready for What's Next?
If you're managing cloud costs today, you already know the landscape has fundamentally changed. The 2025 State of FinOps report confirms what you're likely experiencing: 65% of organizations now manage SaaS spend through their FinOps practices, 49% are tackling licensing costs, and 63% are wrestling with AI investments spread across multiple environments. Yet look at your current toolset—is it still focused solely on public cloud IaaS with limited automation capabilities?

**You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed.** Your peers report attempting to increase effort across 12 different capabilities while reducing effort in only 1-2. This explains why, despite your best efforts, 50% of organizations still cite workload optimization as their top priority year after year. The hard truth? Most traditional tools aren't helping you make meaningful progress.

At CloudBolt our vision is to address these critical challenges once and for all.

## CloudBolt: Breaking the Traditional FinOps Mold
While your current vendor may be tinkering at the edges, CloudBolt is fundamentally reimagining what cloud financial management can achieve: 

### 1. True Multi-Cloud Fabric Visibility
You've heard the "multi-cloud" promise before, but still face fragmented views across providers. With our FOCUS-ready data platform and recent StormForge acquisition, we deliver what you actually need—unified visibility and control across your entire compute fabric. This includes Kubernetes, where 70% of your peers report significant overspending due to container overprovisioning.
### 2. Automation That Closes the Gap
You know the frustration—33% of your optimization recommendations go unimplemented due to competing engineering priorities. Our Cloud Native Actions platform transforms your manual processes into continuous, automated workflows, reducing your insight-to-action lead time from weeks to minutes. This directly addresses what 53% of your peers cite as their critical need for better tooling and automation.
### 3. Open Ecosystem vs. Closed Platforms
Why let a vendor force you into rigid platforms? Our Technology Alliance Program (TAP) enables you to build your ideal FinOps toolkit with specialized capabilities for Kubernetes, SaaS management, commitment optimization, and more.
