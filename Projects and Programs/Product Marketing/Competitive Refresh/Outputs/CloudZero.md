# Is Your FinOps Solution Ready for What's Next?

If you're managing cloud costs today, you already know the landscape has fundamentally changed. The 2025 State of FinOps report confirms what you're likely experiencing: 65% of organizations now manage SaaS spend through their FinOps practices, 49% are tackling licensing costs, and 63% are wrestling with AI investments spread across multiple environments. Yet look at your current toolset—is it still focused solely on public cloud IaaS with limited automation capabilities? 

**You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed.** Your peers report attempting to increase effort across 12 different capabilities while reducing effort in only 1-2. This explains why, despite your best efforts, 50% of organizations still cite workload optimization as their top priority year after year. The hard truth? Most traditional tools aren't helping you make meaningful progress. 

At CloudBolt our vision is to address these critical challenges once and for all.

# CloudZero At-a-Glance:
**Core Focus:** CloudZero focuses on providing cloud cost intelligence by organizing cloud costs into business dimensions like teams, products, features, and customers. Their platform emphasizes unit cost economics and engineering-focused cost management with AI-powered anomaly detection. The platform leverages a proprietary code-driven allocation approach (CostFormation®) that doesn't depend on perfect tagging, alongside their AnyCost™ API that ingests costs from various cloud providers, SaaS tools, and data platforms.

**Best for: (Target Market)**
- Technology and SaaS companies seeking to understand unit costs (cost per customer, cost per feature)
- Mid-market organizations with significant engineering-led cloud operations
- Cloud-native businesses primarily using AWS, Azure, GCP, and modern cloud services
- Organizations wanting to decentralize cost management to engineering teams
- Companies with a mature or maturing FinOps practice

**Strengths and Cautions:**
_Strengths:_
- Superior cost allocation through CostFormation® technology, overcoming tagging limitations for 100% attribution
- Industry-leading unit cost economics capabilities, mapping cloud spend to business metrics
- Broad cost ingestion via AnyCost™ API, supporting diverse cloud services, Kubernetes, and SaaS tools
- Highly-rated customer support with dedicated FinOps Account Managers (FAMs)
- Strong anomaly detection for identifying cost spikes and alerting relevant teams
- Validated partner for specialized platforms like MongoDB and Databricks

_Cautions:_
- Limited automated remediation capabilities, primarily alerting engineers rather than taking action
- Forecasting capabilities not as robust as some competitors based on user ratings
- No native on-premises cost management for hybrid environments
- Implementation requires effort for configuration, with a learning curve for CostFormation®
- Pricing model lacks transparency, potentially based on percentage of cloud spend
- As a venture-backed startup, some enterprise customers may have concerns about long-term stability

# Comparison

### CloudBolt Summary:
CloudBolt offers an integrated cloud management and FinOps solution recognized as a Visionary in Gartner's Magic Quadrant, a Leader and Outperformer in GigaOm's Radar for Cloud FinOps, and a Strong Performer in Forrester's Wave. Our platform excels with its FOCUS-ready data platform providing true multi-cloud fabric visibility across public, private, and containerized environments, significantly enhanced by our recent StormForge acquisition for comprehensive Kubernetes optimization. Our Cloud Native Actions platform transforms manual FinOps processes into continuous, automated workflows, reducing insight-to-action lead time from weeks to minutes and enabling the 40-70% cost reductions our customers typically experience. CloudBolt maintains an open ecosystem approach through our Technology Alliance Program (TAP), enabling organizations to build their ideal FinOps toolkit rather than forcing them into rigid platforms. GigaOm specifically highlights our "superior bidirectional integration" capabilities and strength in hybrid cloud management, while Forrester notes our excellence in "access and permissions, usage policies, and capacity planning." With flexible pricing not tied to cloud spend percentage, CloudBolt delivers both immediate cost savings and long-term FinOps maturity across finance, IT, and engineering teams.

### CloudZero Summary:
CloudZero is a cloud cost intelligence platform positioned as a Challenger in the Forrester Wave for CCMO solutions. Founded in 2016 and venture-backed, CloudZero has built its reputation on enabling organizations to understand cloud costs in business context. The platform excels at mapping costs to business dimensions through its CostFormation® technology, which allocates 100% of cloud spend without requiring perfect tagging. CloudZero is particularly strong in unit cost economics, helping SaaS and technology companies understand cost per customer, feature, or product. Through its AnyCost™ API, CloudZero ingests costs from multiple providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) as well as platforms like Kubernetes, Snowflake, and Databricks. CloudZero uses an "engineering-led" approach to optimization, using AI-powered anomaly detection to alert engineers, who then manually implement changes. The platform is supported by a high-touch customer success model with dedicated FinOps Account Managers (FAMs). While praised for its customer support and unit cost capabilities, CloudZero lacks automated remediation features, has limited on-premises support, and may require significant effort to implement fully.

### When to Choose CloudBolt:
- You need automated remediation of cost issues, not just recommendations and alerts
- Your organization has hybrid infrastructure requiring comprehensive private and public cloud cost management
- You want to reduce implementation complexity with an intuitive, faster time-to-value solution
- Your organization needs optimization capabilities for Kubernetes (via our StormForge acquisition) with machine learning-driven container rightsizing
- You prefer a pricing model not based on percentage of cloud spend
- You need a mature platform with proven scalability for large, complex enterprise environments
- You want comprehensive multi-cloud parity across AWS, Azure, and GCP with consistent features
- You're looking for a stable, established partner with comprehensive analyst recognition

### When to Choose CloudZero:
- You primarily need granular unit cost economics (cost per customer, feature, etc.) as your main FinOps focus
- Your organization is a SaaS or technology company where cloud costs directly impact COGS
- You have engineering teams ready to take ownership of cost optimization actions
- You prefer a high-touch support model with a dedicated FinOps Account Manager
- You need to ingest costs from diverse SaaS tools and data platforms beyond the major cloud providers
- You have significant tagging issues and need allocation capabilities that don't depend on perfect tags
- You're comfortable with an engineering-led approach where insights trigger manual actions
- You prioritize deep AWS cost management capabilities over multi-cloud parity

## Forward Looking: Breaking the Traditional FinOps Mold
While other vendors may be tinkering at the edges, CloudBolt is fundamentally reimagining what cloud financial management can achieve:

### 1. True Multi-Cloud Fabric Visibility
You've heard the "multi-cloud" promise before, but still face fragmented views across providers. With our FOCUS-ready data platform and recent StormForge acquisition, we deliver what you actually need—unified visibility and control across your entire compute fabric. This includes Kubernetes, where 70% report significant overspending due to overprovisioning.

### 2. Automation That Closes the Gap
You know the frustration—33% of your optimization recommendations go unimplemented due to competing engineering priorities. Our Cloud Native Actions platform transforms your manual processes into continuous, automated workflows, reducing your insight-to-action lead time from weeks to minutes. This directly addresses what 53% of your peers cite as their critical need for better tooling and automation.

### 3. Open Ecosystem vs. Closed Platforms
Why let a vendor force you into rigid platforms? Our Technology Alliance Program (TAP) enables you to build your ideal FinOps toolkit with specialized capabilities for Kubernetes, SaaS management, commitment optimization, and more.
