# Is Your FinOps Solution Ready for What's Next?

If you're managing cloud costs today, you already know the landscape has fundamentally changed. The 2025 State of FinOps report confirms what you're likely experiencing: 65% of organizations now manage SaaS spend through their FinOps practices, 49% are tackling licensing costs, and 63% are wrestling with AI investments spread across multiple environments. Yet look at your current toolset—is it still focused solely on public cloud IaaS with limited automation capabilities? 

**You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed.** Your peers report attempting to increase effort across 12 different capabilities while reducing effort in only 1-2. This explains why, despite your best efforts, 50% of organizations still cite workload optimization as their top priority year after year. The hard truth? Most traditional tools aren't helping you make meaningful progress. 

At CloudBolt our vision is to address these critical challenges once and for all.

# Broadcom (VMware) CloudHealth At-a-Glance:

**Core Focus:** CloudHealth focuses on providing visibility, optimization, and governance for cloud costs across public cloud environments, with its strongest capabilities in AWS. The platform consolidates billing data, offers customizable reporting through Perspectives and FlexOrgs, and provides optimization recommendations for cloud resources. Following the Broadcom acquisition, CloudHealth is now exclusively distributed through Arrow Electronics.

**Best for: (Target Market)**
- Large enterprises with significant AWS deployments
- Managed Service Providers (MSPs) requiring white-label capabilities
- Organizations with mature cloud operations seeking broad but standardized cost management capabilities
- Companies willing to accept long-term contracts and premium pricing for an established solution

**Strengths and Cautions:**
_Strengths:_
- Recognized as a Leader in both Gartner and Forrester evaluations with significant market presence
- Superior access and permissions through its FlexOrgs capabilities
- Depth in reporting and monitoring across cloud environments
- Track record with a large and diverse client base
- Strong support for multi-customer operations through MSP capabilities

_Cautions:_
- Significant disruption following Broadcom acquisition with substantial price increases, often unexpected (some customers reporting 2x hikes)
- Deteriorating customer support quality since the transition to Arrow Electronics
- Innovation appears deprioritized under Broadcom ownership with uncertain product roadmap
- Uneven feature support across cloud providers, with functionality favoring AWS over Azure and GCP
- Limitations in reporting customization and cost allocation, particularly with shared costs and virtual tagging
- Complex platform with steep learning curve limiting adoption beyond finance roles
- Rigid commercial terms with elimination of perpetual licensing options

### Broadcom (VMware) CloudHealth Summary:
CloudHealth, now under Broadcom and distributed exclusively through Arrow Electronics, is a traditional cloud cost management platform with a strong historical position in the market. It provides consolidated visibility into cloud costs across providers, optimization recommendations, and governance capabilities. While recognized as a Leader by analysts based on its established market presence, recent developments have introduced significant challenges. CloudHealth excels in AWS environments but shows uneven capability across Azure and GCP. Its reporting capabilities, while extensive, face limitations in scale and customization. The FlexOrgs feature provides strong access controls, but the platform's overall complexity creates adoption barriers. Since the Broadcom acquisition, customers have experienced substantial price increases, support quality degradation, and growing uncertainty about future innovation, with many forced to transition from perpetual to subscription licensing models.

### When to Choose CloudHealth:
- You're primarily an AWS shop with limited Azure/GCP requirements
- You're an MSP requiring white-label multi-tenant capabilities for customer billing
- You already have internal expertise or dedicated CloudHealth specialists who understand its complexity
- You have an established relationship with Arrow Electronics and prefer consolidated vendor management
- You have standard reporting needs that don't require extensive customization or shared cost allocation
- Your organization values analyst recognition and extensive market history over innovation potential
- You don't anticipate needing tight integration with Infrastructure as Code or developer workflows

## Forward Looking: Breaking the Traditional FinOps Mold

While other vendors may be tinkering at the edges, CloudBolt is fundamentally reimagining what cloud financial management can achieve:

### 1. True Multi-Cloud Fabric Visibility
You've heard the "multi-cloud" promise before, but still face fragmented views across providers. With our FOCUS-ready data platform and recent StormForge acquisition, we deliver what you actually need—unified visibility and control across your entire compute fabric. This includes Kubernetes, where 70% report significant overspending due to overprovisioning.

### 2. Automation That Closes the Gap
You know the frustration—33% of your optimization recommendations go unimplemented due to competing engineering priorities. Our Cloud Native Actions platform transforms your manual processes into continuous, automated workflows, reducing your insight-to-action lead time from weeks to minutes. This directly addresses what 53% of your peers cite as their critical need for better tooling and automation.

### 3. Open Ecosystem vs. Closed Platforms
Why let a vendor force you into rigid platforms? Our Technology Alliance Program (TAP) enables you to build your ideal FinOps toolkit with specialized capabilities for Kubernetes, SaaS management, commitment optimization, and more.
