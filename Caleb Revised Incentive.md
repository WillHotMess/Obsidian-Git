# Revised Incentive Plan for Caleb - FY 2025

 **--- _Context_ ---**

The company is transitioning to a double-funnel motion in FY25, emphasizing Account-Based Marketing (ABM) sales development. Additionally, Steve will lead the Account Executive team to take on a more prominent role in initial discovery conversations. These two themes necessitate a change to Caleb's incentive structure. The new model will increase Caleb's focus on high-impact outbound activities using tools like 6Sense and AI-driven tactics, while reducing the burden of early funnel management. Adjustments to Caleb's incentives will place less emphasis on inbound management and provide increased rewards for successful outbound efforts, with uncapped earning potential.          

**Key Changes to Incentive Structure**
- **Reduced Inbound Payouts**: Decreased inbound lead incentives from $75 to $50 per lead to reflect the upcoming shift where Account Executives will take greater ownership of inbound lead discovery, qualification, and hygiene.
- **Lower Inbound Cap**: Reduced the quarterly inbound bonus cap from $3,600 to $2,500 ($10,000 annually vs. previous $14,400) to encourage greater emphasis on uncapped outbound opportunities.
