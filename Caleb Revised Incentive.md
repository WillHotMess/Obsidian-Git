Based on your direction, I'm presenting the continuation of the current incentive model with one modification to the inbound ceiling.

## Incentive Structure Overview

### Personal Performance Bonus

- Total discretionary bonus of $20,000 contingent upon individual performance metrics
- Quarterly assessment and disbursement schedule
- Opportunity verification by marketing and sales operations leadership teams

### Inbound Lead Incentives

- $75 bonus per inbound lead that evolves into an Qualified Opportunity (Qualification stage)
- Additional $75 bonus per inbound lead that progresses to pipelined opportunity (Discovery stage)
- **Revised cap: $2,500 quarterly ($10,000 annually)**

### Outbound Lead Incentives

- $100 bonus per outbound lead that transforms into a Qualified Opportunity
- $125 bonus per outbound lead that advances to pipelined opportunity (Discovery)
- No cap on quarterly bonus from outbound leads

### Additional Incentive Opportunities

This structure maintains the fundamental components of the current incentive model while reducing the annual ceiling on inbound lead incentives from $14,400 to $10,000. The change encourages a greater focus on outbound activities while still recognizing the value of effectively managing inbound leads.

All other aspects of the incentive plan remain unchanged, preserving the clear targets and tangible rewards that drive sales pipeline contribution and business growth.

*Total payout potential exceeds the $20,000 annual discretionary bonus cap, indicating strong incentive for outbound focus

## Key Insights

- Total payout potential across both categories ($25,050) exceeds the annual bonus cap of $20,000, providing strong motivation to maximize outbound performance
- Outbound activities represent 70% of the total payout potential, aligning with the strategic emphasis on outbound pipeline generation
- The projected 19.35 closed won deals would contribute 39.3% to the remaining ARR target of $5,419,916.50
- The incentive structure effectively encourages a pipeline distribution (60.5% outbound) that closely aligns with the company's revenue strategy (52% outbound)

This analysis demonstrates that the revised incentive structure with the reduced inbound ceiling creates appropriate financial motivation to support Caleb's OKRs focused on building the outbound ABM program.
