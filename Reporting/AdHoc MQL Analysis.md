## Performance Summary (Positive Outcomes Only)

- **Baseline Average**: 4.46 MQLs with positive outcomes per week
- **Strong Performance**: Similar to the original analysis, the beginning of the year showed good performance, with weeks 2 and 4 having particularly strong results
- **Significant Drop-offs**:
    - **Week 5 (Feb 2-8)**: Only 2 positive-outcome MQLs, 2.46 below average
    - **Week 8 (Feb 23-Mar 1)**: Only 2 positive-outcome MQLs, 2.46 below average
    - **Week 14 (Apr 6)**: Only 1 positive-outcome MQL, 3.46 below average (note: this week appears to be still in progress)

## Comparison with Original Analysis

The revised analysis excluding "Recycle" and "Disqualified" leads shows:

1. **Lower Baseline**: The average weekly positive MQLs dropped from 8.12 to 4.46, indicating that approximately 45% of MQLs end up as recycled or disqualified
2. **Same Problem Periods**: The same weeks (5, 8, and 14) still show up as significant underperformers, confirming these were genuinely weak periods
3. **More Consistent Performance**: The weekly performance appears more consistent when looking at positive outcomes only, with 8 weeks showing above-average performance compared to 6 weeks below average
4. **Quality vs. Quantity**: While January still shows strong performance, the overall quality of leads appears more consistent through March than the raw MQL count suggested
5. **Major Gap in Week 14**: The current week (14) remains the most concerning with only 1 positive outcome MQL, a 77% drop from the average
