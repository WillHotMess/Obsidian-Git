Subject: Q1 Marketing Pipeline Performance: 147% to Budget with Notable Deals Advancing

Gents,

I am pleased to share our latest pipeline performance metrics which demonstrate strong momentum toward our quarterly targets. We are seeing positive traction from our recent campaigns, though several key opportunities require attention to maintain momentum.

Let me know if we need to connect and discuss this further.

**----**

**Pipeline Highlights**

This Quarter, we have generated **113 MQLs** (94% to budget), **70 SALs** (62% to budget), **30 SQLs** (103% to budget), and **32 Opportunities** (145% to budget), resulting in **$2.8 million** in pipelineâ€”approximately **147% to budget QTD**.

Current pipeline breakdown:

- $365K in Qualification
    - 4 Opps with $0 ARR listed
- $1.5M in Discovery
- $159K in Prove
- $790K in Closed Lost

Overall, we maintain **82 open marketing-sourced opportunities** totaling **$7.8M** in pipeline value.

| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Qualification | 22.2%             | 11.1%           | **66.7%**        | $365,000      |
| Discovery     | 47.1%             | 23.5%           | 29.4%            | $1,512,500    |
| Prove         | 0.0%              | 50.0%           | **50.0%**        | $158,683      |

The data shows **12 opportunities with critical inactivity** (15+ days without engagement), representing $1.1M in potential ARR.

_CRM might not sync activity in some cases. This should be reviewed (see 7-Eleven example below)_

**Top Opportunities Analysis**

| **Rank** | **Opportunity**                       | **Owner**         | **Stage**     | **ARR**  | **Days Inactive** |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| 1        | Sony Interactive Entertainment        | Shishir Garg      | Closed Lost   | $790,002 | 48                |
| 2        | Frontier Airlines - HCM + CB Platform | Shishir Garg      | Discovery     | $250,000 | 42                |
| 3        | Sycomp - FinOps                       | Shishir Garg      | Discovery     | $150,000 | 8                 |
| 4        | Intact Financial Corporation - CFM    | Samantha Harrison | Discovery     | $150,000 | 8                 |
| 5        | Dell Technologies - HCM - Botswana    | Callum Murrell    | Qualification | $100,000 | 13                |
| 6        | 7-Eleven - CFM                        | Logan Tse         | Qualification | $100,000 | 43                |
| 7        | Waters Corporation - HCM              | Samantha Harrison | Discovery     | $100,000 | 0                 |
| 8        | Singtel - HCM                         | Ivan Villiers     | Discovery     | $100,000 | 0                 |
| 9        | Bauer Media Group - HCM/FinOps        | Callum Murrell    | Discovery     | $100,000 | 27                |
| 10       | Minsait - HCM                         | Callum Murrell    | Discovery     | $100,000 | 2                 |

Our largest potential deal (Sony - $790K) moved to Closed Lost this quarter with 48 days of inactivity. However, we have several promising opportunities advancing:

- **Deals that appear to be progressing well:**
    
    - Waters Corporation HCM ($100K): Active engagement, pricing discussions underway
    - Singtel HCM ($100K): Active engagement with their 5000 VM environment
    - Minsait HCM ($100K): Recently active, POC discussions in progress
    - Sycomp FinOps ($150K): Moving forward albeit with some delays (8 days inactive)
- **Opportunities requiring intervention:**
    
    - Frontier Airlines ($250K): 42 days inactive
        - Last documented activity was a FinOps demo on 1/28
        - No evidence of follow-up to schedule the needed HCM demo
    - Dell Technologies Botswana ($100K): 13 days inactive, no defined next steps
    - 7-Eleven CFM ($100K): 43 days inactive in CRM
        - Next steps show outreach on 3/10, but CRM shows last activity on 2/12
        - Data inconsistency requires investigation
    - Bauer Media Group ($100K): 27 days inactive
        - Business case was being presented internally in early March
        - No activity since follow-up scheduled for mid-March
    - University of Alabama ($97.5K): 64 days inactive
        - Budget constraints until Oct 2025 noted
        - No nurture strategy documented

The next steps analysis reveals that while many opportunities have documented plans, execution and follow-through appear inconsistent. I recommend we review the engagement strategy for our top deals, particularly the $250K Frontier Airlines opportunity which represents 9% of our current pipeline.

In summary, while we are exceeding our pipeline targets, activity levels suggest we need to improve our engagement consistency to maintain momentum through the quarter.

| 7    | HCA Healthcare - CFM                  | Samantha Harrison | Prove     | $700,000 | 74            | Critical    |
| 8    | TELUS Corporation - CFM               | Shishir Garg      | Discovery | $300,000 | 243           | Critical    |
| 9    | Schaeffler - Metsi - CMP              | Callum Murrell    | Discovery | $107,580 | 155           | Critical    |
| 10   | Getronics - CMP                       | Callum Murrell    | Negotiate | $164,847 | 15            | Progressing |

### Deals progressing well:
- **Bynet Data Communications ($350K)**: Recent demo completed (April 7) with good fit identified for 10,000+ VM environment. Deep dive demo scheduled for April 25.
- **Getronics - CMP ($164K)**: MSP and PSA agreements have internal approval. Final paperwork and order form in process with anticipated close by mid-April.
- **Sycomp - FinOps ($150K)**: Deep dive completed March 17. Seeing good value in CB for BillOps and FinOps, though likely Q3/Q4 close due to existing contract.

### Opportunities requiring intervention:
- **Frontier Airlines ($250K)**: 71 days inactive. Last activity was FinOps demo on January 28, with no follow-up for the needed HCM demo.
- **HCA Healthcare ($700K)**: 74 days inactive. Working with Deloitte on pricing, but no recent engagement logged in CRM.
- **TELUS Corporation ($300K)**: 243 days inactive. Last meeting was August 9, 2024. Need to validate if this is still an active opportunity.
- **Dell Technologies - Future Fusion ($400K)**: Contact reported internal reorganization on March 14, with progress slowed. Regular check-ins needed.

## Key Recommendations
1. **Immediate Intervention Required:** Schedule engagement meetings for Frontier Airlines, HCA Healthcare, and TELUS Corporation to validate status and prevent potential loss of $1.25M in pipeline.
2. **Process Improvement Needed:** Implement a consistent activity logging policy across the team, as 67% of opportunities show recent activity in Next Steps comments but not in CRM activity dates.
3. **Pipeline Cleanup:** Review and update the 54 opportunities older than 90 days, which represent $5.72M in pipeline value. Consider implementing a 180-day age threshold for mandatory review.
4. **Close Date Realism:** Many opportunities show unrealistic close dates relative to their stage and activity level. Update these to improve forecast accuracy, particularly for deals with critical inactivity.
