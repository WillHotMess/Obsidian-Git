# Weekly QTD Sales Pipeline Analysis: April 18, 2025

## Introduction

I've completed the analysis of our current quarter-to-date sales pipeline. We're seeing steady growth with 22 MQLs, 11 SALs, 3 SQLs, and 6 new opportunities, generating $450K in pipeline value. While we're making progress, we need to focus on converting more deals through the funnel and addressing some concerning activity patterns.

## Pipeline Highlights

| Metric         | Current  | Quarterly Target | % to Target |     |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --- |
| MQLs           | 22       | 101              | 21.8%       |     |
| SALs           | 11       | 95               | 11.6%       | 50% |
| SQLs           | 3        | 25               | 12.0%       | 27% |
| Opportunities  | 6        | 19               | 31.6%       |     |
| Pipeline Value | $450,000 | $2,061,525       | 21.8%       |     |

Our opportunity creation is our strongest area at 31.6% of target, while SAL conversion represents our biggest challenge at only 11.6%. The total pipeline value aligns with our MQL performance at 21.8% of quarterly target.

## Activity Status Overview

|Stage|Recent (0-7 days)|Mid (8-14 days)|Stale (15+ days)|Total ARR|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Qualification|33.3% (5/15)|13.3% (2/15)|53.3% (8/15)|$1,325,000|
|Discovery|8.8% (3/34)|8.8% (3/34)|82.4% (28/34)|$3,924,424|
|Prove|0% (0/6)|0% (0/6)|100% (6/6)|$539,350|
|Proposal|0% (0/2)|0% (0/2)|100% (2/2)|$70,670|
|Negotiate|0% (0/1)|0% (0/1)|100% (1/1)|$164,847|

**Concerning patterns:**

- Only 8 of 58 opportunities (13.8%) have had activity within the past 7 days
- 100% of opportunities in Prove, Proposal, and Negotiate stages are stale (15+ days inactive)
- Overall, 82.8% of our pipeline has not been touched in over 15 days

|Dell Technologies - Future Fusion - HCM|Logan Tse|Discovery|$400,000|35|Internal reorganization causing delays|
|Zoetis - CFM|Samantha Harrison|Prove|$175,000|39|POC scheduled for May 19, needs active engagement|

## Key Recommendations

1. **Immediate Activity Push**: All reps should contact any opportunity inactive for 15+ days this week, especially high-value deals like Dell Technologies ($400K) and HCA Healthcare ($700K).
    
2. **Qualification Process Improvement**: Our SAL-to-SQL conversion rate is concerning at 11.6%. Implement more rigorous qualification criteria to improve conversion rates through the funnel.
    
3. **POC Acceleration Strategy**: Schedule weekly review sessions for all deals in Prove stage, as 100% are currently stale. Begin with Zoetis ($175K) and Gijima ($200K).
    
4. **Deal Momentum Program**: Establish a weekly dashboard showing inactive days by stage and implement a "red flag" system for opportunities exceeding recommended contact frequency.
    
5. **Forecast Adjustment**: Based on current activity patterns, we should adjust our pipeline forecast by 15% downward for the quarter unless we can substantially increase activity rates in the next two weeks.
