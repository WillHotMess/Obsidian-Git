# SQL Analysis: Role Distribution & Cloud Capability Interests

**TO:** CloudBolt Leadership Team  
**FROM:** Sales Operations  
**SUBJECT:** Analysis of SQL Job Titles & Cloud Capability Interests - Q4 2024

## Executive Summary

I've conducted a quick analysis of our Sales Qualified Leads since October, focusing specifically on job titles and the cloud capabilities they're exploring. This analysis aims to provide insights into who is engaging with our content and what problems they're trying to solve.

## SQL Role Distribution

After consolidating similar roles, here's the breakdown of our SQLs by job function:
- **Note**: 6Sense lead scoring works by creating an ideal customer profile (ICP) based on our past customers and sales cycles. This ICP is then used as a model to evaluate incoming leads. The closer to the ICP a lead is, the higher the lead score.

## Cloud Capability Interest by Role

Our BOFU form asks leads: **"What specific cloud capabilities or solutions are you exploring?"** with the following options:
- Financial Reporting
- Billing & Distribution
- Cost Optimization
- Kubernetes Optimization
- Chargeback/Showback
- Automation/Orchestration
- Cloud Provisioning & Self-Service
- Governance Controls
- Other

Here's how interests align with roles:
**Note:** **Cost Focus Transcends Roles**: Cost Optimization appears in the top 3 priorities for all role categories, suggesting cloud cost focus across all functions.

| Role Category                      | Primary Interests                                                              | Secondary Interests         | Trend                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Cloud Infrastructure Engineers** | • Cloud Provisioning (83%)<br>• Governance (77%)<br>• Automation (75%)         | • Cost Optimization (65%)   | Increasing cost focus        |
