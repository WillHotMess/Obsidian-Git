# Weekly Marketing Pipeline Performance Update - April 11, 2025

Team,

I'm sharing this week's pipeline performance metrics which show positive momentum building in Q2, though we still need to accelerate conversion in the middle of our funnel.

## Pipeline Highlights
QTD, we generated **15 MQLs** (14.8% to quarterly budget), **5 SALs** (5.3% to quarterly budget), **0 SQLs** (0% to quarterly budget), and **2 Opportunities** (10.7% to quarterly budget), resulting in **$450,000** in new pipelineâ€”approximately **21.8% to budget QTD**.

**Quarter-to-date status:**
- 22 MQLs (21.7% to Q2 budget)
- 6 SALs (6.3% to Q2 budget)
- 1 SQL (4.0% to Q2 budget)
- 4 Opportunities (21.3% to Q2 budget)
- $450,000 pipeline created (21.8% to Q2 budget)

**Current overall pipeline health:**
- 84 Total Open Opportunities
- $7.8M in outstanding pipeline value
- **Average opportunity age:** approximately 185 days (6 months)

## Activity Status Overview
Our activity metrics reveal concerning patterns that require attention:

| Stage         | Recent (0-7d) | Mid (8-14d) | Stale (15+d) | Total Count | ARR   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----- |
| Qualification | 28.6%         | 14.3%       | **57.1%**    | 14          | $365K |
| Discovery     | 32.7%         | 17.3%       | **50.0%**    | 52          | $4.9M |
| Prove         | 46.2%         | 23.1%       | 30.8%        | 13          | $1.3M |
| Proposal      | 50.0%         | 25.0%       | 25.0%        | 4           | $325K |
| Negotiate     | 100.0%        | 0.0%        | 0.0%         | 1           | $165K |

**Note**: Our CRM data suggests significant inactivity, but 67% of opportunities show activity in their Next Steps comments, with 45 opportunities showing April 2025 activity dates. This highlights a persistent gap in activity tracking that needs addressing.

**Deals progressing well:**

- **Singtel ($200K):** POC kicked off this week for 5,000 VM environment
- **Zoetis ($175K):** Call scheduled for April 9th to discuss next steps for CloudHealth migration

**Opportunities requiring urgent intervention:**
- **Dell Technologies Future Fusion ($400K):** Internal reorganization causing delays, needs executive outreach
- **TELUS Corporation ($300K):** No activity since August 2024, requires immediate reengagement
- **Frontier Airlines ($250K):** No activity since January demo, missing follow-up for HCM demo
- **AT&T ($205K):** POC still in testing phase, license was extended, needs progress check

Let me know if you'd like to schedule time to review any specific opportunity in more detail.

Best regards,

William

- Cloud Architects and Directors of Cloud Engineering together account for nearly 20% of all SQLs
- The growing FinOps Analyst role (3%) reflects increased focus on cloud cost management

This data shows our solution appeals most strongly to hands-on technical implementers and the managers who oversee cloud infrastructure, with Cloud Architects being our single most common SQL title.
