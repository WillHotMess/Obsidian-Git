We have a new marketing request form! As you all know, we’re expecting a lot of exciting changes in the coming months, so we’re implementing a new request form in order to streamline the process and ensure proper follow-up and delivery.

If you need anything from marketing (one-pagers, graphics, events assistance, etc.) please click on the link below and fill out all necessary information (the more details the better), and we'll be in touch to get the process started.

This form will be standard operating procedure for all future marketing requests so please bookmark this link for future use. 

The link is also available under Marketing Requests in the Confluence Sales Playbook!
