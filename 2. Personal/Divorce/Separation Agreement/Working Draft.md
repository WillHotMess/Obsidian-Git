## Questions You Should Ask

2. **Support Calculation**: Have you run the official NC Child Support Worksheet to determine the guideline amount? What are both current incomes for this calculation?
    
3. **Special Needs Planning**: How does Miller's autism affect long-term support needs beyond typical Miller emancipation age? Should you include provisions for adult disabled Miller support?
    
4. **Debt Verification**: Have you both pulled credit reports to ensure all debts are identified? Are there any joint debts not listed?
    
5. **Retirement Valuation**: Have you valued the marital portion of both 401(k)s to ensure equity in the division?
    
6. **Tax Implications**: Have you consulted a tax professional about consequences of property transfers and support payments?
    
7. **Legal Review**: Have you each consulted with separate attorneys to review the final agreement before signing?
    
8. **Health Insurance**: What happens if William loses his job or employer-provided insurance? What's the contingency plan?
    

## Additional Advice

1. **Document Everything**: Create a detailed inventory with photos of personal property and household items.
    
2. **Legal Formality**: North Carolina requires separation agreements to be notarized. Ensure your final document meets this requirement.
    
3. **Miller's Needs**: Consider including provisions for therapy consistency, educational advocacy, and decision-making specifically related to autism support services.
    
4. **Communication Plan**: Consider using dedicated co-parenting software like Our Family Wizard or AppClose to document all communications and expenses.
    
5. **Mediation Clause**: Specify the mediator selection process and cost division more clearly.
    
6. **Financial Updates**: Include a provision requiring annual exchange of financial information, especially if support amounts are tied to income.
    
7. **Future Modifications**: Include language addressing when and how the agreement can be modified as Miller's needs or your circumstances change.
    
8. **Emotional Support**: Consider family therapy to help Miller adjust to the new arrangements and to build effective co-parenting skills.
    
9. **Post-Divorce Relationships**: Include provisions about introducing new partners to Miller (timing, process).
    
10. **Documentation**: Maintain a shared document repository for Miller's medical, educational, and therapy records.
