**Katie, Sarah,** 

I took some time to review the Partial Separation and Child Custody Agreement drafted by Hannah's attorney and have concerns about discrepancies from our discussions and what Hannah and I had mutually agreed upon (verbally).

**Separation Date:** The agreement claims we separated on May 20, 2025, but Hannah will continue residing in our home until June 5th.  We cannot have legally separated while still living together, making June 6th the earliest possible separation date.

**Newland v. Newland Reference:** The agreement cites this case, but our situation is fundamentally different from Newland:
- We're still in active marriage counseling (attempting reconciliation - last appointment was Monday May 2nd)
- We still largely function as a married couple, (though my wife is sleeping in another bedroom)

**Financial Concerns:**
1. Hannah verbally requested I pay the mortgage "from my own checking account" for May, despite her residing there the entire month.
2. I plan to pay from our joint account as usual. Additionally, all household expenses (mortgage, gas, electricity, utilities) paid from the joint account through June 5th will reduce the total amount available for our 50/50 split.
	1. Is this the correct approach?
3. The agreement reserves ALL financial claims (alimony, property division, child support) despite our detailed mutual agreement on dividing assets, waiving retirement rights, and splitting RSUs.
	1. What should be our plan for pressing that these details be added?
4. Should the document include the agreed-upon financial arrangements for childcare, therapy costs, and health insurance? 

**Key Questions:**
- Is Hannah's lawyer aware we're still in marriage counseling?
- Can we be legally separated while actively trying to reconcile and living in the same house?
- How enforceable is this "partial" agreement without specified child support amounts?
- Can we insist the final document include our complete property division agreement (retirement waivers, RSUs, investment accounts)?
- **We need to clarify whether this is truly "interim"** - the waivers in Section 5 suggest everything remains open

This document appears to be a placeholder/boilerplate that doesn't reflect our actual agreements and contains materially false statements about our separation status. 

We can chat through this next week. 

_Thanks,_ 
_Will_

Your draft email is a strong start and clearly outlines several major concerns regarding the discrepancies between your mutual understanding and the lawyer's proposed agreement, especially concerning the separation date and the reservation of financial claims.

To make your discussion with your lawyers even more productive, consider adding these points and questions:

**1. Critical Discrepancy in the Custody Schedule:**

- **Point:** "The child custody schedule in Section 4 of the lawyer's draft (a 2/2/3 split) is _fundamentally different_ from the 3/3/4/4 schedule Hannah and I agreed upon and detailed in our own draft. This needs to be corrected to reflect our 3/3/4/4 agreement."
- **Question:** "How do we ensure the 3/3/4/4 custody schedule, including the weekend distribution we agreed on, is accurately and unambiguously incorporated into the agreement?"
    

**2. Omission of Key Child-Related Agreements:**
- **Point:** "Our draft included specific restrictions on relocation (remaining in-state and within 1 hour of Miller's ABA) and outlined transitions primarily occurring at school. These are missing from the lawyer's draft."
- **Question:** "Can we insist on adding the agreed-upon relocation restrictions? What are the risks if we don't include these? Should we also specify the preferred transition locations and transportation responsibilities?"
- **Question:** "Our draft specified that William provides healthcare insurance unless Hannah's is better, and that extra expenses are split proportionally. Since the lawyer's draft reserves child support, how should we handle these _specific_ cost-sharing agreements now?"
    

**3. Specificity on Property Division:**

- **Point:** "While the draft reserves most property claims, it _does_ distribute the car to Hannah but _omits_ the offsetting agreement that William retains specific investment accounts (Fidelity/Robinhood)."
- **Question:** "If we must proceed with a partial agreement (which I question), shouldn't it at least include _all_ the linked agreements, like the investment accounts offsetting the car value? Why were these specific items we agreed on left out?"
- **Question:** "Why are the agreed-upon RSU details (both Hannah's and William's) and the 401(k) waivers completely absent?"

**4. Tax Implications:**
- **Question:** "Our agreement stated we would alternate the dependency exemption, with Hannah claiming the first year (2025). Can we add this specific point to the agreement now?"

**5. Practicalities and Legal Implications:**
- **Question:** "The lawyer's draft declines to specify exchange times. Given Miller's needs, isn't it better to have set times/locations as a default, even if we allow for mutual flexibility?"
- **Question:** "Could you explain the full implications of the 'Non-Abandonment' clause and confirm it protects me as intended?"
- **Question:** "What is the typical legal strategy behind presenting an agreement that reserves almost all major financial issues and differs so significantly from prior discussions? Should we interpret this as a standard opening position, or does it signal potential difficulties ahead?"

**Suggested Closing Addition:**

You might add a sentence like: "My goal is to reach a fair and comprehensive agreement that reflects what Hannah and I discussed, ensuring clarity and minimizing future conflict, especially regarding Miller's well-being and financial stability. This current draft seems to fall far short of that."

By including these additional, specific points, you will provide your lawyers with a very clear picture of the gaps and concerns, enabling them to advise you more effectively on the best path forward.

Subject: Concerns Regarding Draft Partial Separation Agreement

Hi Katie and Sarah,

I took some time to review the Separation Agreement drafted by Hannah's attorney, and I have several concerns. It varies considerably from the agreement Hannah and I discussed and outlined in the draft I shared previously, particularly regarding the separation status and financial matters.

**1. Separation Date & Status:**

- **Discrepancy:** The agreement states our separation date was May 20, 2025. However, Hannah will be residing in the marital home until at least June 5th. We also attended marriage counseling as recently as Monday, May 22nd with an additional session booked for the week of June 9th. 
- **`Newland v. Newland`:** The draft cites this case, but given we are still cohabiting (though in separate rooms) and were actively attempting reconciliation after May 20th, it feels fundamentally different.
- **Questions:**
    - Can we be legally separated while still living together and attending marriage counseling?
    - What is the earliest _legally sound_ separation date we can use?
    - Is Hannah's lawyer aware we were still in counseling post-May 20th?

**2. Financial Concerns & Omissions:**
- **Mortgage/Expenses:** Hannah requested I pay the May mortgage from my personal account. I plan to continue paying it, along with other household bills, from our joint account until she moves out. My understanding is these payments will reduce the final balance of the joint account before the 50/50 split.
	- Is this the correct approach?
    
- **Reservation of Claims:** The draft reserves _all_ financial claims, including alimony, child support, and most property division. This contradicts our detailed discussions.
    
- **Missing Agreements:** Our draft agreement included specific divisions and waivers that are now missing:
    - William retains Fidelity and Robinhood accounts to offset the car purchase. The lawyer's draft gives Hannah the car but omits this offset.
    - Waivers for each other's 401(k)s and company equity (RSUs/Stock Options).
    - Details on William's CloudBolt RSUs.
    - Proportional splitting of therapy, medical, and childcare costs.
    - William providing health insurance.
    - Alternating the tax dependency exemption, with Hannah taking 2025.
        
- **Questions:**
    - Is it worth insisting that these previously agreed-upon details (offsets, waivers, RSU handling, cost-sharing, tax credits) be included now, rather than "reserved"?
    - How enforceable is a partial agreement like this, especially without any mention of child support?  Does reserving these claims truly keep them open, or could we lose ground by not addressing them now?

**3. Missing Custody & Logistical Details:**
- **Relocation:** Our draft included vital restrictions on relocation (staying in-state and within 1 hour of Miller's ABA). This is completely missing from the lawyer's draft. 
- **Cellphone Plan:** Our agreement on handling the T-Mobile plan costs and phone balance was omitted.
- **Questions:**
    - Can we insist on adding the relocation restrictions?  What are the risks if we don't?
    - Should smaller items like the cell phone plan also be included for clarity?

This document seems to be a very basic placeholder. It doesn't accurately reflect our situation or our prior agreements and even contains what appear to be materially false statements about our separation status.

My goal is to reach a fair agreement that reflects what Hannah and I discussed and minimizes future conflict, especially regarding Miller's well-being and financial stability. This current draft seems to fall far short of that.

We can chat through this next week.

Thanks,
Will
