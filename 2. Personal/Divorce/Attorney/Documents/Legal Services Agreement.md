1. **Regarding the Minimum Trust Balance (Section 6c):** The contract states that a 'minimum balance of $_TBD_' must be maintained in the trust account. 
	- Could you please specify in writing what this minimum balance amount will be?
2. **Regarding Contract Validity and Payment (Section 11):** Section 11 mentions that 'payment [must be] remitted within 14 days of its receipt for the contract to become valid.' 
	- Could you please confirm exactly which payments (e.g., the $500 General Retainer, the $5,000 Initial Trust Account Fee, or both) must be remitted within this 14-day period to validate the contract?
3. **Regarding Current Hourly Rates (Section 3 & "CURRENT RATES" Section 1b):** 
	- Could you provide a current schedule of hourly rates for all attorneys and staff who might work on my separation agreement? 
	- Also, how and when will I be notified if these rates change during my representation?
4. **Regarding Scope of Services (Sections 1 & 6d):** The contract specifies representation for a 'Separation Agreement.' 
	- Can you confirm that services related to an absolute divorce, or any enforcement or modification proceedings, are not covered under this agreement and would require a new fee arrangement?
5. **Regarding Flat Fees (Section 3):** Section 3 mentions that 'Some documents are charged flat fees for first drafts only.' 
	- Could you specify which documents, if any, related to my separation agreement might qualify for a flat fee for the first draft, what those fees are, and what services are included in that flat fee?
6. **Regarding the 10% Monthly Administrative Fee (Section 3):** 
	- To confirm my understanding, the 10% monthly administrative fee is applied to the total amount of billed _services_ each month, correct? 
	- It's not applied to other expenses or costs, just the fees for attorney and staff time?
	- This effectively increases my hourly rates by 10%? 
7. **Regarding Disputing Bills (Section 6):** The contract states that any questions about a bill must be raised within fifteen days of receipt. 
	- This is a short time to dispute bills.
	- When and how will I receive monthly statements? 
	- Given this short timeframe, what is the best way to submit questions or raise a dispute if I have concerns about a monthly statement? 
8. **Regarding File Retrieval (Section 10):** I note the 30-day period to retrieve my file upon termination of representation, after which it will be destroyed. 
	- This is a _very short timeframe_ for getting files from the team - does the firm automatically provide this digitally throughout the engagement? 
	- If representation ends, what is the process for requesting my file, and to whom should that request be made to ensure it's handled within the 30-day window?
9. **Regarding Additional Trust Fee for Court Action (Section 6c):** Section 6c mentions that 'an additional trust account fee will be required' if court action is necessary. 
	- Is there a typical range or estimate for this additional fee, or how would that amount be determined?
10. **Regarding Communication Methods (Section 16):** Section 16 indicates email as the primary method for all communications. 
	- If there are particularly sensitive matters I'd prefer to discuss via phone or in person, what is the process?
