Speaker 1:  
″Like are you planning on keeping it or selling it?″  
  
William:  
″Sorry, I need to change speakers here.  
Can you hear me?″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yes, I can hear you.″  
  
William:  
″I don't know what is going on.  
Am I planning on keeping what, the car?″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″The house.  
What is the plan with the house?  
Oh, gotcha.″  
  
″I'm not sure I saw.″  
  
William:  
″That's another thing is we've not figured that out.  
I think we need to have a position because she's, you know, she's kind of like trying to punt the ball down the field a little bit, but it's also like the house is extremely expensive and like, it's not that I can't afford it on my own.  
It's just not comfortable.  
And it's, she signed a year-long lease I don't I don't think it makes any sense to like wait to have an opinion on that...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yeah, yeah.  
OK, yeah, I don't think I.  
OK, I see savings accounts, child custody.  
Support.  
Huh? OK, yeah, so separation ingredients they sent over is like really just a temper.  
Like let's get something in place on custody and divide some funds but it's not actually resolving all the claims yeah no it's okay...″  
  
William:  
″Kind of ridiculous yeah I mean like I had listed out if you saw my draft. Did you get that draft?  
Do I just need to send it to you right now? Yeah. Okay like I'd look. Um is it the bullet pointed one?″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Correct. Yep. Yep I've got that in front of me right now. Cool the only thing that's changed...″  
  
William:  
″From that is that we did we did move to a 2233 schedule that's agreed upon. Okay.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Okay, that was gonna be one of my questions.″  
  
William:  
″Just 'cause, yeah, it just makes more sense.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yeah, okay.  
Okay, good. I mean if you guys are agreeing on a custody schedule honestly that's one of the two biggest fights I'd say we see in separation.  
So if you guys are in agreement on a custody schedule, that gets you a big step forward...  
And really helps with the amicability of the process overall. So that's good.  
Cool.  
OK.″  
  
William:  
″And then like she's taking the car and I need to go lease a car this Friday, essentially, or go buy a car, something.  
Right. And I initially put in there like, oK, I'll keep the stock market accounts.  
You take the car so I can use those stocks to like offset.  
And she did none of that.  
You know, there's no way all the stuff that she said she was totally fine to wave in verbally. She just did.  
They just didn't include.  
Whether it's a hill to die on, I don't really know, but it's just interesting to me that if she told me in person, like, "My lawyer thinks I'm crazy, I could go get alimony, i could get all these things," you know, he clearly wanted to push her to do a lot more, and I think this was just maybe her way of being like, "I don't want to deal with any of this, just like, whatever, do something temporary and we'll figure this out later."  
Um, what does she have like what is...  
Yeah.  
Her income she's a she's a full-time executive assistant for a tech company so she's she's close to 100 000 a year...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Okay, okay.  
Yeah, okay, well, let me kind of keep going through this.  
Okay, so in terms of property division, i see you've got like some joint accounts.  
So you just have the one car.  
What did you guys do when you were married with just one car?″  
  
William:  
″We both work from home.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Okay, well that makes it easier.  
So you're okay with her keeping that vehicle, it's just a matter of how we balance it out, right?″  
  
William:  
″Yeah, I want her to have a car and I want her to have something safe for Miller I'm totally fine going out and getting a car I'm just worried that like then she's gonna try to take that asset later and also like if she's gonna take half the savings and and and and it doesn't really make any sense...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Okay, so what I think we need to do, honestly, is I'm gonna reach out to her attorney this week to even get a hold of him.  
Um, I mean, if long term, I mean, are you like, would you prefer to keep the VW or like, are you okay with that being her vehicle, like post separation?″  
  
William:  
″Yeah, I'm fine with that being her vehicle.  
I just think it just needs to be, you know, factored in somehow.″  
  
″Yeah.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″And that was my next thing is like, it will definitely be factored in.  
So generally when booking big picture, one of my steps when I am figuring out equitable distribution, which is that property division, is I create a spreadsheet that includes all of the assets.  
The house, the mortgage on the house, the car, if there's a loan on the car, all of the joint accounts, all of the like, any separate bank accounts, retirement accounts, credit card debts, everything, both marital and separate.  
And so, you know, if we put the value of the VW in Hannah's column, then, you know, it has to be balanced out somewhere in your column.  
Okay.″  
  
″Yeah.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yeah.  
So, that will definitely be accounted for later on.  
Which would be interesting.  
So they're trying to resolve custody and so they're doing a partial distribution of property, which we might call an interim distribution.  
And...  
And...  
You know, sometimes we do that when there's like even litigation pending or something, we will ask for an interim distribution just to get someone enough assets to live off of or just like, you know, in this case like a car or whatever like they need a car to work or to take the kids somewhere. And so that isn't unheard of but it is 100% considered in the overall picture of the equitable distribution. So it's not like it's like, okay, that's, you know, a one-time...  
Division and we're done or that that's, you know, separated out, it is still considered in the big picture.  
So, so I can definitely, you know, speak with her attorney and say, hey, like, we're okay with her account, like, taking the card for now, but like, we want that, like, and I can make a note to him of like, hey, we're like...  
Not gifting Mr. Hart, this is going to be part of the distribution.  
Um, and they should know that as well.  
Um, are you okay with the bank account being divided right now?  
So that way you have some funds to go out and buy a car?″  
  
″Or would you rather just hold off on all of that?″  
  
William:  
″I took 20 something thousand out a few weeks ago just to protect it.  
But I can send you like a current snapshot via email of like minus the mortgage minus the bills for this month what is remaining.  
She took out about 8,000 for her down payment on her new apartment and then I took out 20 just to safeguard it.  
I can also move that back like whenever but it's like essentially like the Delta between the burn down of all of those.  
Know house paint like all the house bills then factoring in the 8,000 she took out factoring the 20 and then splitting out the difference if that makes sense like cuz I I can I can I'm not explaining it well because it's been a long day but I I can I can kind of net it out yeah yeah...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yeah, so one of the things that we will do is after this call I will have Katie send you a document request to rest and a financial offer David and things like that basically spreadsheets and or list of documents that we want you to provide to us and that'll include bank statements. So hopefully we can see in those as well like...  
Like when you took the 20,000 out and all of that, and once you took the 8,000 out.  
And it may be something, yeah, where like that account, you know, obviously the 20,000 that you took out will be put in your column and factored in on how the rest of that account is divided.″  
  
William:  
″Yep, and then the 8,000 that she took out, and then whatever, yeah, right.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yeah.″  
  
William:  
″The other thing that's just maybe noteworthy is, and I don't think she cares, but when we talked about it, she's like, you keep your 401k, I'll keep mine.  
You keep your stocks and shares, I'll keep mine.  
I don't want 'em, like, whatever.  
I don't know how well that all works in the world of North Carolina...  
Equitable distribution thing and she...  
Because I know there's like this...  
Said she was trying to wave them away and wave that stuff away. I don't know where that went or if that was just her lying about it. I don't really know. Just something to consider. I have a whole bunch of RSUs for my company. They're like 50 cents apiece right now and they're worth something in the future, hopefully significant, when we sell our company. I really like, just between you and me, I'd like to fight to keep those. I don't know how that works.  
It's just we pay out the value or we just go like you keep the car, Will keeps these things or whatever. I don't think she's really gonna fight for them to be honest. I really don't think she's gonna care. It's just a question of like is her lawyer gonna try to like you know push it in that...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Direction. Right, right. Well and if you know on your agreement you made it know that she's got RSUs as well so it might be one of those things where it is...  
Something where you just say, "Okay, everyone just keeps their own. We call it a day." I have, so it's honestly an area that like I'm not, I would have to do a little bit of research on or you might have to educate me on it on exactly like how if at all. Those can be divided because I know every company does it.  
You know, sometimes it's like, you know, a stock that has no value yet or you know something like that that doesn't have a value until the company is sold, but technically was bought or earned during the marriage. So, yeah.  
Yeah, but it may not be something where, like, I've seen times where I've had clients who say, "Well, I can't actually give this to another person, so it can't really be divided even."  
Yes.  
And in that case, yeah, we want to like, give her more value somewhere else or agree to give her more, you know, alimony or something, or yeah.  
I mean, I think our first position is, you know, everyone just keeps their own and call it a day.  
As long as you're okay with that, and as long as the numbers for that are in your favor, i'm okay with that being our first position and then seeing kind of what they push back on.″  
  
William:  
″Yeah, they are.  
They're definitely in my, they're definitely, she's said so many times in person and she's really not out to get a bunch of money from me.  
She's just like, I wanna go be independent.″  
  
″Yeah.″  
  
William:  
″Like, so it's going to be her lawyer's position that's gonna cause issues here.  
I do think going back and being like, you keep the car, Will will sign over the title, waive your rights to this, the 401k, he'll waive yours.  
Like, if we just go with that position, the lawyer's gonna have to bring that to him.  
Yeah.  
The Hannon go, like, here's what they're saying, and she's probably going to say, I don't care.  
But, I think it's where we start and see what happens. Like the house stuff I don't I think we need to get an appraisal and prep like prep the house for sale in the next six months and we need to put that in writing like I mean you know and it you were going to therapy Hannah has said out loud that she's willing to try to like you know mend fences here but I think like the couple her and I we need to make a decision about the house within the net we need to time box that and we need to go and we're not gonna wait right to like pay down equity on this like and Will's just gonna own it all like we need to have a plan of action...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″So, so overall, like, I believe I think my plan and let me know if this is kind of in line with with your thoughts are, you know, I call her attorney this week and say, Hey, like, let's let her take the car.  
That's fine.  
We want it to be like balanced out later you know the joint accounts have already started to be divided so let's just finish that division and then let's negotiate all of the terms at once because entering a separation agreement that's only a partial agreement makes no sense I also my personal preference is never to include child like I prefer child custody to be in a court order so we can agree on the terms in a separation agreement but then follow it up with like a friendly complaint and a consent order memorializing all those terms but considering the age of your child you're most likely going to modify custody at some point and it'll be much easier to do that if there's already a court order in place and like I said that can still be agreed upon and like entered without like contentious litigation but then yeah like you're talking like special support child support ED like...  
We'll handle them later like there's no point in us like negotiating this partial separation agreement and then having to negotiate another one. We might...  
Respond to that with a complete offer.  
And get it all done in one separation agreement is my thought.  
And part of that, going back to your comment on the house, yes, one, I think getting an appraisal makes a lot of sense.  
Two, we would include terms in that separation agreement that are very specific of like, the house gets listed immediately or within like 30 days of signing the agreement.  
You guys have to agree on the realtor.  
Like, it includes terms on like, you know, how close to the listing, like the parties must accept any offer within like 5% of the listing price, things like that.  
So it is very, very specific.  
So that way you guys can't, like don't have to hassle and negotiate like all the rest of that. It's just, okay, this is what we're doing in the house.  
And it's like kind of wiggle like, you know, there aren't any, like, there's no wiggle and laughed and that's actually very...  
Standard thing to do.  
So, that shouldn't be put back.″  
  
William:  
″The big piece here is like, if, she said to me like, I don't want alimony, i don't need spouse support, i need child support for Miller, you know, and we're like, well, just do the state calculations.  
And I'm like, that's fine.  
But if the, I lose a third of my income by her leaving...  
I keep, I have to then solely pay for the house, which is, you know, whatever, $4,000 a month.  
Then I have to go buy a car.  
Then I have to give child support.  
Like if they come back and they're trying to do like alimony or spouse support, which she said she doesn't want, but I guess the lawyers like you could definitely get it.  
Like there's no like work this the house has got to go to sale. I mean I literally cannot afford five different like like losing a third of my income and then all these additional payments. It's not gonna happen. So and I hear you...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″And so that's so what we'll do is one of the documents Katie is gonna send you it's called a financial affidavit and that's basically a budget spreadsheet and so you're gonna put on there your like total income all the deductions your net income and then all of your expenses and it has a current call or like a data separation column which is like you're gonna put that on there like your expenses like when you guys were living together in the same house married and then there's a current column and what I often suggest especially if you are saying I've got to sell the marital home, is figure out where you'd move to and figure out what those expenses, what that mortgage, what that rent, what those utilities would look like, and put all of that in that column.  
And then we can see at the bottom kind of what you have left over, if anything.  
And we can also factor in child support.  
And basically the purpose of that is to kind of show the other side is like, hey, after all of his expenses and after paying child support, there's either negative dollars left over or there's only like X amount of dollars left over for spousal support.  
That way they can't just come in with an arbitrary number because one of the factors for spousal support is your ability to pay.  
And no judge can order you to pay more spousal support you know that you have left over at the end of the day.″  
  
″Yeah.  
So.″  
  
William:  
″How do the judges look at Spouse of Support in Alamoni when it's like, she literally is just leaving.  
Like, there was no infidelity, there was no, like, she just straight up bails on the marriage.  
I mean.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yeah, so that's a good question.  
So North Carolina is a no fault state.  
So what that means is no party has to prove anything to get a divorce in North Carolina.  
It's just a year and a day.  
Right, sure.  
Now how that impacts spousal support is, spousal support, the factors for spousal support are, one party has to prove that they are a dependent spouse and they have been throughout the marriage and that one party is a supporting spouse.  
Then you have to show that the dependent spouse has a need.  
So she's gonna produce a financial affidavit that shows hey you know after my income and even after I get child support I still need this amount of money to like pay you know my rent and my expenses. And then the other is like I just explained your ability to pay. To some degree standard of living during the marriage comes into play and that usually comes into play in circumstances like I have one client who during their marriage they regularly went on international vacations. So therefore like if you know if the wife claims oh well you know I should have 10,000 a year to travel that was a standard during the marriage, it's not as ridiculous as it would be in other cases. So you know it's like her standard during your marriage has been she gets her nails done every single week, she could claim so like, and, and then we look at the length of the marriage.  
So alimony generally lasts for half the length of the marriage.  
Um, and that's a generalization, but alimony is a very, very gray area.  
There's no guidelines on how exactly it's calculated.  
With regards to like, fault affairs, et cetera, the only factor that might come into play is if one party had an affair.  
So if the supporting spouse has an affair, they have to pay something.  
If the dependent spouse has an affair, then they are no longer entitled to alimony.  
But in North Carolina, like, those--  
Other than that, it doesn't really come into play.  
So, like, even though she's made the decision to leave the marriage and you know, without reason, she is still entitled to alimony if all of the other factors exist.″  
  
William:  
″Got it. So I mean, is it as simple as them typically, like well I guess you said it's great, but I mean are they just going to look at her circumstances and go, "You don't really need this, you've got enough money on your own?" or are they going to go, "This is the life you had, this is the delta, now we're going to try to make that work?"″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″So, like I said, there's, I mean, different, it's very subjective, so obviously we're trying to avoid going in front of a judge at all, in which case it's gonna be me and her attorney kind of negotiating back and forth and proving, hey, you don't have the ability to pay or she has a need and we're kind of, where are we laying on that?  
If she has an...  
But a judge would look at all those factors i just talked about.  
Actual need the judge is probably going to base it off of that. So it's in a lot of ways it is like just a calculation of like okay you know what does William have to pay after child support and what is Hannah's need you know what's the overlap there.  
I mean, they're not gonna just like give her an arbitrary amount of money, and they're not necessarily gonna give her everything she asks for, you know, 'cause they're gonna look at like, are her needs actually reasonable?  
So it's, but it is, it is a very subjective calculation.  
So I can't tell you exactly how every judge does it, unfortunately.″  
  
William:  
″It's fine.  
I mean, we'll take it one day at a time.  
I mean, I guess the best case scenario is just, she doesn't go for it and we just move on.  
I mean, they haven't brought it up yet, so I just think we don't bring it up.  
Unless it gets brought up, it's just like, hope it doesn't become a thing.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yeah, and in some cases where they get pushing on special support, sometimes I have my clients negotiate and agree to slightly hire child support in lieu of alimony.  
Since child support is modifiable and likely to be modified in the future anyway, it just locks you in.  
It doesn't lock you in as much as alimony.  
But yeah, we can definitely see kind of what they're offering their position is there.″  
  
William:  
″Okay, so I think, you know, the net here is like, I am not comfortable being in financial and protective limbo for my daughter, for me, for Hannah.  
I think the second that you move out of the house and take all your stuff and sign a year lease it's like well we got to start playing like this is for real even if we mend fences and so I think our position needs to be like this current draft does not do enough to protect the welfare of everybody here and like i mean we had you know Hannah and Will verbally sat down and created this list things may have changed slightly like this is this is kind of what we're going in with we do think we need to have like I also think is one of those like if if we go in with this agreed-upon kind of thing like then we have a little bit more time with the house if all of a sudden we're starting to talk about other things then we need to shorten that timeline with the house so when you talk to him like it's kind of like it really totally depends on this interim year of like how much financially is gonna you to get pulled out and it brings the savings account down to minimal and then it becomes like this joint expense that we have that it's a big house, we have landscapers, we have all these things all of a sudden rest on one person when they lost a third of their income like whether or not that's something I can hold on to for six months largely depends on what they fight for right now and I think even at the six-month market needs to be like we got to get this sold before the end of the year for sure. Yeah, yeah.  
Have a real estate agent we've worked with in the past, I'm sure that'd be the one we agree on. I certainly think we need to at least get a market review of the house from them in the next 30 days.  
I think the date of separation being June 1st is just a clean number. That way it's like we don't have to play any games about the mortgage and the bills for May. It's like, nope, you live there, the week of June 1st.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″And yeah, and that reminds me, so for all like the mortgage and like utilities and joint bills, was that pulled out? I think you mentioned that that was all pulled out of your joint account for me, correct?″  
  
William:  
″Correct, and I can list those out.  
So we both stopped our salaries going into that joint account after the mid-cycle paycheck.  
So our last paycheck at the end of the month, both went to pride our own personal accounts.  
And then we used the joint account, I used the joint account to pay the mortgage because i wasn't going to use my personal because she lived there the whole month.  
And we had like a couple other bills that came out of that account.  
My thought is now that counts not in use.  
There's no income coming in.  
There should be no more bills going out.  
So take the 8,000 that she already pulled, the 20,000 that I already pulled, the difference is 12 or whatever, right?  
Basically take where it was after the two paychecks went in on the 15th, less the expenses that we paid at the end of the month, less the money that we already took out, and then...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Divide the difference. So I think that the issue that they're going to have with that is they're going to say that that 20,000 is part of your half. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying.″  
  
William:  
″And the 8,000 is part of her half.  
Right, so the calculation is she already took 8, I already took 20.  
We're taking the amount of money that we had in the middle of the month after our paychecks went in, less the expenses that we have, dividing that in half, and then only paying out the delta between 8 on her side and 20 on my side.  
And then closing that account, just like get the money out, close it up.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yeah.  
Okay.″  
  
William:  
″But yes, yes, the 20 is factored and the 8 is already factored.  
I'm just not articulating it right.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yes, yeah, yeah, I hear you.  
Um, I agree with that.″  
  
William:  
″And then I'm, I'm assuming all of the debt that was on our credit, our mutual credit cards that we're using and I'm paying that out of my personal account this month, so I will factor all of that in when I send it to you as well.  
Because I'm not going to use our joint accounts for that, but it is absolutely we both have been using those accounts.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yes, so you've got a couple options there.  
One is you can remove her name from any joint credit cards.″  
  
″Yep, I've done that.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Okay, and then, yeah, any payments you made towards, yeah, marital debt, definitely track that and we will factor that in.  
You can potentially get a credit for it.  
I'm not saying you're gonna, but it'll definitely be a piece of leverage at minimum.″  
  
William:  
″Okay, yeah, I mean, that one to me is like simple.  
It's like she had these credit cards in her wallet.  
We used it for groceries.  
We used it for like whatever around the house.  
And, but I'm gonna have to pay them off in June for May.  
So, yeah.  
I have all of our transactions like literally in a spreadsheet from all of our accounts. I don't have her credit card that she's got but the other thing that was interesting is I think she had some expenses that she put on my card for travel and then she got reimbursed to her personal account so I might need to figure out what that was. Okay but it's these are all just little pieces here like I hope it doesn't come to this but I just have a feeling with things...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Like this it just it's gonna at some point in time. Yeah yeah um okay so like I said my next to reach out to her attorney, and I'm not gonna negotiate all of the details at this point, I'm just gonna let them know, hey, we're okay with her taking the car for now, we're gonna account for it later, let's figure out how to split the remainder in that joint account, 'cause I'm sure their math is gonna be different than ours, that's how it usually goes.  
Get them to an agree to an appraisal on the house, the date of separation, and let them know like, hey, there's no point in us negotiating a partial separation agreement, let's just negotiate the whole thing.  
I mean, we can then draft up our own separation agreement includes all terms and send it to them as an offer.″  
  
″I think that's right. And I think if there's any pushback there, just a couple thoughts that came to my mind.″  
  
William:  
″Like one, she signaled to her counselor that like there's only a 15% chance of her and I getting back together or something like that. She also signed a year-long contract at Rosario lease. And in their temporary separation agreement, they literally list out like there is, they use the Newland versus Newland case, which I looked up and he literally wrote out like there is zero intention from either party to get back together. So I'm like, it's kind of speaking out of both sides of your mouth if you're going to do like a temporary thing, but then there's no intention from your standpoint, doesn't really make any sense to me. So i don't think there's going to be a problem there. I just as like thoughts for you. It's like, I don't, i don't really don't get how they could put the verbiage that they did in their agreement, but then also go like we don't need a full separation agreement. It's kind of talking...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Out of both sides of your mouth. So I think because I think what they're worried about is like getting certain things in place immediately, just like you are. Like you said, like I want wanna, you know, move on this quickly.  
I want some reassurances regarding custody.  
And I think that's exactly their thought as well.  
It's like, hey, let's like knock out a couple of easy pieces and get some security with the custody.  
And then we can come back and negotiate everything else.  
I think that's where they're coming from.  
I don't know that I've ever seen a partial separation agreement before, but I have seen people do bits and pieces.  
I've seen people sell their house right away and then say, okay, we'll negotiate everything else in six months at mediation, because they just needed to get out of the house and get money to live on their own.  
So I've seen it done a bunch of different ways. This is a little odd, especially if you guys are currently amicable about a 223 schedule. I don't see me to like rush into a cut the agreement immediately.  
Yeah. Um and and we can always kind of do some like something informal in writing between nima between the attorney saying, hey, like we're in agreement that until there's a separation and agreement in place, we're on X, Y, and Z schedule. Right.  
Um, you know, I don't know if there's obviously we're coming up to, to father's day to summer vacation.  
So if, if there are certain things that you want to make sure, like in addition to that two, two, three, three that is agreed upon such as you get specifically father's day, no matter how that land or, you know, if you want to take your daughter on vacation, you know, coming up, let me know. Um, and we can definitely have, you know, sorted.″  
  
William:  
″I'm like, we're using a co-parenting app already. It's downloaded. It's called, uh, you've probably heard of it. It's called like app them or them, them, us, something, something like that. I don't remember what it was. Um, but we have our whole schedule.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Oh, that is actually a different one.″  
  
William:  
″App Close is what we are using.  
But it has the schedule in it.  
We've already agreed, like, if there's some change to the schedule, just we'll put it in there and we'll make sure we account for whenever we have Miller.  
That way we know the distribution and we have all the communication of at least change.  
Like, we'll text each other for normal stuff, but for like that schedule we're gonna use.  
So like, I think we're not in a place where any sort of protections need to be there.  
Okay, perfect.  
You know, and that hopefully doesn't change.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yeah, no, that sounds really good.  
Okay, well, then do you have any other questions for me?  
Do you want me to kind of go over like big picture process or anything like that?″  
  
William:  
″You know, whatever you think I need to know, you know, the only other thing, maybe there's one other thing that I'll just tell you, like, I don't think it's, I don't think it's going to be a big deal.  
She got access to the bank.  
Well, she's always had access to our mutual bank account, but she, for the first time, logged in the other day, as far as I understood it, and she found some ATM transactions when I was in Vegas with coworkers at, at a strip club, unfortunately, which is not the greatest look in the world.  
It's not a pattern.  
It was just kind of an executive pulled me and a couple of coworkers to this.  
Okay. - And I don't know, like it doesn't seem like she's gonna be able to use that against me, or she even wants to, but I'm just letting you know that that's the only real like risk of her finding anything. - Okay.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″When did that happen?″  
  
″When did you go to Vegas?″  
  
William:  
″It was like November 23, I think.  
A couple years ago.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Okay, so it was like before you guys were contemplating separation.″  
  
William:  
″Correct.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Correct, and OK, I mean, did anything like happen at the strip club?″  
  
William:  
″No. OK.  
And I was there, it was like just with coworkers.  
And it wasn't even that late.  
And I mean, not like all these details really don't matter when you just look at like black and white transactions, but like the money that was pulled out was used because my buddy got his credit card stolen and I didn't actually use up money.  
Like I left most of the cash.  
Like we weren't even there that long, but it's just the optics of that.  
I don't know how they factor into anything.″  
  
″Okay.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″I'm not super worried about it because like you said nothing happened and honestly even if anything did happen well, I guess I mean if she just found out about it's a little bit different but um yeah, I'm not super worried about it since nothing happened and it's not like there's like proof of an actual affair or anything like that...″  
  
William:  
″And like I also have people that would be willing to like whatever if we ever needed it.  
It's like you like, no, it was just coworkers and it wasn't, you know, it was just drinks at a bar.  
But I don't, yeah.  
And I'm just letting you know like it's because it's not, not because it's like a pattern.″  
  
″Yeah, no, no.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″I appreciate you telling me, one thing I tell every client is, i need to know to be quite honest, any skeletons you have in the closet, i need to know them sooner rather than later because the worst thing that can happen is you think something's not gonna come out or whatever and then I'm on a call or we're in court or something and they bring it up and I don't know anything and that makes me look bad but it also makes me unable to actually defend our position.  
So if you have any skeletons in the closet, if you have any, I mean, whether it's about financial affairs, anything skeletons in the closet or otherwise, like things that you think I need to know about your position, please let me know, you know, we have attorney-client privilege.  
It's not going anywhere, you know, so.″  
  
William:  
″I mean, there's literally nothing, there's nothing else.  
That's the only, that is the only thing.  
And there's, it's like, I don't really know what kinds of stuff she would even bring up.  
I mean, I think she's probably wanting to avoid court, like the plague.  
The sense that I get from her is like, she just wants to go be independent and like do her own thing, which I think plays to our favor, to be honest, because she's not like out for blood, pissed off at me.  
Like she's just kind of like, i want to be independent and be alone.  
That's what she's telling everybody.  
And she's told me.  
So I just throw that out there cuz I'm like I don't really think there's there'd be much for her to like try to grasp on to...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Okay.″  
  
William:  
″Cool.  
But yes, I will keep everything totally transparent.  
Okay.  
Anything that happens, I will, or anything that comes up or anything she says, anything at all that just strikes me as being worth noting, I will definitely let you know.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yeah, yeah.  
Okay, so I mean, I'm just gonna kind of do a brief overview, make sure you know, like kind of the big picture.  
So, you know, we talked about equitable distribution, that's the division of the marital assets that is in North Carolina, like it's a generally presumption of 50/50 split of all those assets, but there are some factors that could sway it one way or the other.  
The ones we might see in your case are things like assets that can't be divided, such as the RFUs.  
But generally it's a fairly even split.  
But generally it's a fairly even split. Then we have like we talked about spousal support so we'll see kind of how how they fight about that because your marriage is only five years I think even if they come after us like it's not a very big claim because you'd be talking about paying two maybe two and a half years worth of alimony.  
Um, then, you know, custody, we haven't actually touched on custody very much.  
Does that seem to be fairly equitable or amicable?  
I did want to mention that there are two different pieces of custody.  
One is legal custody, which is like the right to actually make decisions about your daughter's life.  
So education, medical, general welfare.  
That I rarely ever see anything other than joint legal custody.  
So I'm really not worried about that in your case.  
But we can discuss if there's any specific terms that you want in that section, especially regarding like her disability and, you know, how decisions are made and things like that.  
Which is exactly what it sounds like. That's the custodial schedule along with like holidays, you know, how you guys communicate, how you're able to communicate with your daughter, all of that stuff. And it looks like you've kind of considered a lot of those things in your draft separation agreement already. So I think we'll be in a good place on that. And then last is child support.  
Is based off of the North Carolina guidelines and your gross income. And the one thing to know on that is that it includes like income is defined very very broadly there so if you pretty straightforward, probably W-2 income for both of you.  
But if you do get like once a year bonuses, those count.  
They just get divided by like 12, things like that.  
So I just want to make you aware that that is a very broad definition.  
So.  
Yeah.  
Everything counts, it's worth income, but we basically plug in those numbers, factor in who's paying for any work related childcare expenses, health insurance for your daughter, and then it pops out a number.  
So once we have your financial information stuff, i'll start running those calculations so we have an idea of where that might land.″  
  
William:  
″Okay, sounds good.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Obviously, you guys going to be living in two different households starting next week.  
Okay, and then the last thing I'm gonna ask you about is...  
Um, so does she like the one thing we might want to consider is like some form of interim child support.  
Um, so you know, it sounds like, you know, if we're dividing the joint accounts, um, and she doesn't have access to your credit cards anymore, like you're not providing her with any financial support and I just don't want them to come back and say, oh, you owe me back child support and all that stuff.  
Granted, hopefully we'll have things wrapped up relatively quickly, so it won't be that big of a deal.  
Um, but it might be something for you to consider of like, Hey, you know, yeah, Hannah, like i'll pay you X amount per month or, you know, if, if, um, you know, if your daughter is in childcare, maybe say like, Hey, I'll cover that for now until we got things settled or whatever you're comfortable with.  
Um, and then how that might be divided.″  
  
William:  
″All right, I'll think about it.  
I mean, is there any, like, is the, i guess I'm just, like, the mortgage, just me just assuming it is because I live there, right?  
Like, so that's not gonna matter.  
Okay, I'm just gonna have to figure out if there's a number, I don't know.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″So the one thing to consider, like the one thing I'll make a note of on the mortgage is that as an asset that you guys end up selling and splitting the proceeds, any mortgage payments you make in that time, you can get a credit for the principal, any portion of the principal that is paid off.  
So yes, it kind of sucks that you're having to pay the mortgage, but like you will get some credit on the back end for that.″  
  
William:  
″And all the, all the, anything the real estate, I talked to Gray about this, anything the real estate agent recommends us doing to sell the house, I should be keeping all of those receipts.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Yes, so that is one term we can negotiate as well in the separation agreement.  
So I've seen it multiple ways of like, hey, sometimes it's like one person has to pay all of it, or if it's split, or yes, or you could get a credit for any painting or anything that the realtor recommends that you guys do, if you pay for it, yes.  
I would say let's keep receipts...  
But we'll definitely negotiate how that cost is taken care of.″  
  
William:  
″Alright, well I will send over anything you need to send over for me to consider and I will try to do that.  
I'm going to be super busy, I am super busy all week so it's going to be like end of week potentially for me to get that over to you maybe to the weekend.  
And yeah.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″That's okay. Yeah, I'll have Katie, like I said, send you our list of documents that we generate requests and our financial affidavit and she'll send you the instructions for all that as well as a share file link on like how to, where to, for you to securely upload your documents and stuff.  
Yeah, just get to it as soon as possible, but like no rush to get it done before the end of the week.″  
  
William:  
″Awesome. Okay. Great.  
Well, I appreciate all the help.  
I will.  
I'm sure we'll be in contact soon.  
I think we can just find our next meeting once we get through the first kind of tranche of work and figure out when we need to discuss again.  
I assume that'll be whenever I get this stuff submitted and whenever he comes back with whatever conversation you guys...″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Have.  
So I'll keep you updated on any conversations I have with her attorney and then yeah, we'll probably, once I have all the financial information, we'll set up another call or something.″  
  
William:  
″Well, thanks for everything. If you need anything at all, just reach out to me via email and I look forward to continuing the conversation.″  
  
Speaker 1:  
″Will do. I will talk with you soon. Have a good day.″•
