# Summary of Legal Consultation Call with Sarah

**Date:** June 2nd, 2025

## Key Case Updates

**Custody Agreement Progress:**
- **Schedule Change:** Moved from 3/3/4/4 to **2/2/3 schedule** (mutually agreed)
- Using **AppClose co-parenting app** for scheduling and communication
- Generally amicable on custody arrangements - Sarah noted this is "one of the two biggest fights" they typically see, so agreement here is significant progress

**Property Division Status:**
- **Car:** Hannah taking the 2021 VW Tiguan - William is fine with this but wants it factored into overall property division
- **Joint Accounts:** Need to complete division of remaining funds after:
    - William withdrew $20,000 (for protection)
    - Hannah withdrew $8,000 (apartment deposit)
    - Remaining balance to be split 50/50 after accounting for these withdrawals
- **Investment Accounts:** Each keeping their own (401k, RSUs, stock accounts) - Hannah previously agreed verbally but this wasn't included in their draft agreement
- **House:** No decision yet on long-term plan (sale vs. buyout)

## Major Financial Concerns

**William's Financial Situation:**
- Losing 1/3 of income when Hannah moves out
- Must solely cover $4,000/month house payments
- Needs to purchase a car
- Child support obligations
- Potential alimony exposure (though Hannah verbally said she doesn't want it)

**Sarah's Assessment:** These financial pressures make house sale likely necessary within 6 months

## Legal Strategy & Next Steps

**Sarah's Immediate Actions:**

1. **Contact Hannah's attorney** this week to:
    - Discuss car arrangement (temporary with credit for final division)
    - Complete joint account division
    - Push for **comprehensive separation agreement** rather than partial/interim agreement
    - Propose house appraisal and sale timeline
2. **Document requests** to be sent by Katie (Sarah's assistant):
    - Financial affidavit
    - Bank statements and financial records
    - Asset/debt documentation

**Strategic Position:**
- Propose each party keeps their own retirement/investment accounts
- Include specific house sale timeline and process in final agreement
- Calculate child support per NC guidelines
- Prepare financial affidavit showing William's limited ability to pay alimony

## Risk Factors Disclosed

**Strip Club Incident:**
- ATM transactions from November 2023 Vegas trip discovered by Hannah
- No misconduct occurred - was work-related with colleagues
- Sarah not concerned as no actual affair/misconduct took place
- Witnesses available if needed

## Outstanding Issues for Final Agreement

1. **House disposition** - sale timeline, realtor selection, expense allocation
2. **Complete asset/debt inventory** and valuation
3. **Child support calculation** based on actual incomes
4. **Spousal support negotiation** (if Hannah's attorney pushes for it)
5. **Life insurance and college planning** provisions

## Timeline & Next Steps

**Immediate (This Week):**
- Sarah contacts opposing counsel
- William receives and completes financial documents
- No major financial moves (like car purchase) until draft agreement received

**Short-term (Within 30 days):**
- House appraisal
- Complete financial disclosures
- Review opposing counsel's comprehensive agreement proposal

**William's Action Items:**
- Complete financial affidavit when received
- Gather all requested financial documents
- Track all post-separation expenses and debt payments
- Await Sarah's feedback after speaking with Hannah's attorney

Sarah emphasized this appears to be a relatively amicable separation with good potential for negotiated resolution, especially given the custody agreement already in place.
