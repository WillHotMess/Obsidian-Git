## Key Lawyer Insights and Recommendations

**Interim Agreements & Risk**
- Interim (temporary) agreements are common and can cover things like property division, child support, and custody for a set period (e.g., six months), with the understanding that terms will be revisited.
- If the interim agreement includes waivers of rights to things like alimony, retirement accounts, or RSUs, those waivers are typically permanent. It’s crucial to specify which provisions are interim and which are final.
- If your spouse waives spousal support in an interim agreement, it can be beneficial for you, as it shows she can manage independently and may minimize future claims.

**Property and Asset Division**
- Splitting joint accounts 50/50 as of the date of separation is legally sound.
- Each party keeping their own retirement accounts and waiving rights to the other’s is a standard, clean approach.
- Giving your spouse the paid-off car is reasonable, especially if it reduces her expenses and your potential liability for spousal support. The car’s value should be credited to her in the final division.
- Keep receipts for any post-separation expenses or improvements to the marital home. If the house is sold, whoever paid for improvements can be credited from the proceeds.
- The home’s equity as of the date of separation is typically split 50/50, but post-separation principal payments or value improvements may be credited to the person paying them.

**Child Custody and Support**
- The 3/3/4/4 custody schedule is acceptable, but the lawyer suggests considering a 2/2/3 or 2/2/5 schedule for more predictable weekends and fewer transitions.
- Joint legal and physical custody is the norm in your jurisdiction, and the burden would be on your spouse to prove otherwise if she later sought sole custody.
- Child support should be calculated per North Carolina guidelines, with additional extraordinary expenses (medical, therapy, childcare) split proportionally based on income.
- Use a co-parenting app for communication, scheduling, and expense tracking.

**Financial Logistics and Protections**
- Both parties are entitled to half of joint accounts as of the date of separation; transferring funds to new individual accounts is fine, as long as it’s well-documented.
- Avoid purchasing a new car until your spouse has officially moved out, to ensure asset division is clear and uncontested.
- Cell phone plans and other shared contracts should be separated as soon as practical, with clear agreements on cost sharing until then.

**Long-Term Considerations**
- The marital home’s future (sale, buyout, refinancing) should be addressed in the final agreement, with a timeline and process for valuation and division.
- Life insurance and college savings plans for your child should be discussed and formalized, but the court cannot require post-secondary support or life insurance—these must be by agreement.
- Include language in the agreement about how and when modifications can be made as circumstances or your child’s needs change.

**Legal Representation and Process**
- The lawyer recommends starting with document review and consultation for cost-effectiveness, but is open to full representation if the situation becomes more complex or adversarial.
- A $5,000 retainer is standard, with hourly rates varying by attorney. You can meet with potential attorneys to ensure a good fit before committing.
- The immediate next step is to review the draft agreement your spouse’s attorney provides, highlight concerns, and consult with your lawyer before signing anything.

## Immediate Action Items
- Wait for the draft agreement from your spouse’s attorney before making any major financial moves (e.g., buying a car).
- Split joint accounts 50/50 as of the date of separation, documenting all transfers.
- Schedule a follow-up consultation to review the draft agreement in detail and identify any risks or missing elements.
- Keep detailed records of all financial transactions and home-related expenses post-separation.
- Use a co-parenting app for all child-related scheduling and expense tracking.
- Plan for appraisal or market analysis of the marital home to set a baseline value for future discussions.

---
## Outstanding Issues to Finalize
- Long-term plan for the marital home (sale, buyout, refinance).
- Detailed process for dividing furniture and other physical assets.
- Finalize language and processes for expense tracking, reimbursement, and communication protocols.
- Life insurance and future education funding arrangements.
- Mechanisms for modifying the agreement as circumstances evolve.

## Lawyer’s Closing Thoughts
You’ve been deliberate and logical in your approach, which will help you move forward. Since your spouse is working on an agreement, it’s best to wait and review what’s proposed before taking further action. There’s no need to rush to file anything preemptively—focus on reviewing the agreement carefully and responding appropriately.

**In summary:**  
Your lawyer sees your approach as thoughtful and well-prepared, recommends careful review of any interim agreement (especially regarding what is permanent vs. temporary), and suggests taking deliberate, well-documented steps as you move forward. The focus should be on protecting your long-term interests, especially around custody, the home, and financial stability, while keeping the process as amicable and cost-effective as possible.
