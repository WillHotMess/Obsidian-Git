## Session Recap

**Current Situation:**
- Hannah moved out first week of June after signing a year-long lease
- They've been separated about 1.5 weeks
- Hannah had asked Will if he could see a future together - he said yes, she said no and took off her ring

**Will's State:**
- Describes feeling like his "house burned down" - emotionally exhausted
- Feels Hannah architected this separation privately and he was only brought in "for the final act"
- Not ready to work on the relationship yet, needs time to adjust to being a single father and establish his own emotional safety
- Frustrated by the contrast between his experience of their marriage (happy, getting positive signals) vs. what was apparently happening in Hannah's mind

**Hannah's State:**
- Hit a "breaking point" - feels relief having her own space but also guilt about hurting Will
- Says this wasn't a hasty decision but something she'd been thinking about for a long time
- Struggling with memories of good times vs. remembering why she left
- Needs space to process potential changes, doesn't want to fall back into old patterns

**Core Issue - The Value/Worth Dynamic:**
- Hannah feels her value was consistently tied to productivity and income throughout their relationship
- Triggered her childhood trauma around not having inherent worth as a person
- Specific example: Will questioning her travel/income after a work trip, even after she apologized
- Hannah says this was a pattern, not isolated incidents

**The Financial Discussion Conflict:**
- Will pushed back, saying he never explicitly said her value was tied to income
- Detailed explanation of their Jersey restaurant conversation about mutual decisions on career paths and lifestyle
- Will feels he's being blamed for decisions Hannah made (like working two jobs)
- Hannah maintains she felt constant pressure regardless of explicit statements

**Therapist's Key Insight:**
- Brendan explained how harmful narratives develop through subtle cues, tone, word choice - not just explicit statements
- Both partners contribute to these dynamics through how they show up in conversations
- The truth is usually "in the middle" of both experiences

**Resolution for Now:**
- Will requested a pause, saying they're both too emotionally flooded for productive work
- Hannah agreed to focus on co-parenting for now
- Scheduled follow-up session for a month out (week of the 14th)
- Both acknowledged they need individual healing time before potential relationship repair

**Underlying Dynamic:** The session revealed a classic pattern where one partner feels unheard/devalued over time while the other feels blindsided and defensive, with both having valid but very different experiences of the same interactions.

Here's how you might frame this tactfully in your next session:

"Brendan, I've been thinking about what you said about both partners contributing to unhelpful narratives. I want to understand my part in this, but I'm also struggling with something and need help with it.

I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells because I'm afraid any difficult conversation will be interpreted as me attacking Hannah's worth or value. I know her trauma history makes her more sensitive to perceived criticism, and I want to be mindful of that. But I also feel like I can't bring up legitimate concerns - whether it's finances, parenting decisions, or relationship issues - without being seen as the villain.

It's exhausting feeling responsible not just for what I actually say and do, but also for how Hannah experiences it through her trauma lens. I end up feeling demonized for intentions I never had. I want to be sensitive and supportive, but I also need to be able to have real conversations about real issues without feeling like I'm walking into a minefield.

How do we break this cycle? How can I be more sensitive to her triggers while also being able to address problems in our relationship without being cast as the person who makes her feel worthless?"
