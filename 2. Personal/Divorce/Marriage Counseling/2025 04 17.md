# Structured Journal Entry for Marriage Counseling

**What I'm most grateful for in our relationship right now:**
- That we are both taking steps to get healthier with one another

**What I appreciate about my partner that I haven't expressed:**
- The little sacrifices Hannah makes that give me room for work and running hobby.
- Her willingness to provide care and nurturing to Miller and our dogs in a highly perceptive way, which offsets my blind spots and low perceptiveness.

**My biggest concern or fear about our relationship:**
- That our marriage will fail because:
    - Hannah was not fully honest with how she feels and what she needs from me
    - I am not able to put in the work to try and change or better myself
    - Hannah won't notice, accept, or recognize the effort I put in, or it will not be enough

**Patterns I notice in our conflicts or communication:**
- Low, medium, and high intensity conflicts seem to trigger Hannah's fight or flight trauma response
- I struggle with de-escalating situations or bringing conversations back to a productive place, causing even smaller issues to become high intensity
- Hannah appears to be harboring built-up baggage from our relationship, resulting in momentary concerns uncovering larger pent-up issues


- Vyvanse has been extremely beneficial to my mental health. I feel productive and motivated to get things done, which is helpful given the amount of busy days I face. However, one potential side effect is that it can lower my emotional intelligence and make me seem robotic or just a taskmaster. I want to explore how Hannah feels about this and discuss ways to increase her awareness or potentially adjust my intake.

**What are]I want to accomplish in counseling this week:**
- Get moving quickly so that we can begin to heal the wounds.

**One thing I would like to try this week:**
- Start carving out specific time each week for us "to run our business" together. This means spending time talking through the upcoming week, identifying where we need support, reviewing current expenses, discussing big tasks that need to get done, and addressing other items we tend to avoid talking about.
