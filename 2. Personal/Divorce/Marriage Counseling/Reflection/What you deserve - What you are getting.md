I know you are in a lot of pain, and there is so much you deserve from me that you are not getting.  

- You deserve to be listened to; instead I am quick to debate. 
- You deserve to be understood; I am trying to explain my side or add context. 
- You deserve to feel acknowledged; I am not making any legitimate acknowledgment believable, because I am terrible at just shutting up and just hearing you. 
- You deserve to be mad and confused; I keep asking for answers and timelines. 
- Most importantly, you deserve to feel that you are with someone who you can be vulnerable with when you are upset; but you don't feel that way, and its my fault. 

And that breaks my heart. 

I love you so much, and I know that nights like tonight, only push you farther.  

Its clear after I step away and reflect, that I am being unintentionally toxic every single time. I am so quick to try and fix, challenge, or defend that I dig the hole deeper.  I am sure it is exhausting and you don't deserve it. 

I am not going to reason this away, or try and soften this behavior by sharing why I do these things. It doesn't matter the intention, if the outcome is negative. 

What I know is that I want to be a more selfless, caring, and empathetic person for you. And, while it is awful it took this happening to turn some lights on, I am just trying to be hopeful you will give me room to prove I can make it happen. 

One note isn't going to solve this, but let me tell you what I do know. I do know that I need to really focus on changing myself; starting with my approach. 

I am going to reflect on how I can do better in the coming week. When you come back, I want you to know that I am trying harder, in my own imperfect way. Starting with reading this to myself everyday, and learning to just listen. Not debate or solve or defend. 

All I need from you is just to have faith that we can get through this and hope that we will be better on the other side. 

I am truly sorry. I don't ever want to hear you say, honestly, that you feel you wonder if you would be happier without me. If I cant earn you feeling that is not the case, that I don't deserve it to be true. 

I am here for you when you need me, and I am also ready to just back off. 

I love you.
