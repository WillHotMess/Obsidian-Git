- Hannah informed me that a lawyer is drafting a 6-month temporary separation agreement. 
- She told me that her lawyer said she thinks she's stupid that she is not going for more based on what I make. 
- She said she could probably get alimony and more. 
- She said that her lawyer is going to me the agreements to review by Friday. 
- Hannah asked for me to send to send her half of our savings (via text):
	- She then asked me in person “What are we going to do about the savings?” 
	- I told her that I was going to speak to my lawyer before I made initiated any transfers. Which she got defensive with. 
	- I also told her she can write herself a check (her name is on our accounts checks)
	- I also told her she has an Ally login (under her personal email) and that she has a debit card in her name. 
- She then texted me:
	- “If I’m not getting any savings until you talk to your lawyer and negotiate then I want the 5,300 plus my last paycheck which was $3,329”
