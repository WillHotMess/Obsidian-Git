## Core North Carolina Family Law Principles for the AI's Knowledge Base

The AI's effectiveness as a legal assistant hinges on a robust and accurate knowledge base grounded in North Carolina law. This section outlines the fundamental legal principles that must be incorporated.

**A. Foundations: Legal Separation, Grounds for Absolute Divorce, and Residency Requirements**

Understanding the foundational concepts of how marriages are legally paused or dissolved in North Carolina is paramount.

**1. Legal Separation**

In North Carolina, legal separation is a factual state rather than a court-decreed status in most instances. It occurs when spouses begin to live in different homes, and critically, at least one of the spouses possesses the intent for this separation to be permanent.1

A common misconception is that a formal document, like a separation agreement or a court order, is necessary to be legally separated. This is not the case for the mere status of separation itself.1 The intent to separate permanently, coupled with physically maintaining separate residences, are the key elements. Living apart for reasons such as work, without the requisite intent by at least one party for the separation to be permanent, does not constitute legal separation. Similarly, if spouses intend to separate but continue to live under the same roof, they are not considered legally separated for the purposes of divorce prerequisites.1

The "Date of Separation" (DOS) is a fact of profound legal significance that the AI must be programmed to identify and track accurately. This date serves as the starting point for the mandatory one-year separation period required for a no-fault divorce.10 Furthermore, the DOS is the pivotal date for valuing most marital property for the purpose of equitable distribution.3 The AI must emphasize to the user the two essential components for establishing the DOS: the physical act of living in separate homes and the subjective intent of at least one spouse that the separation is to be permanent.10 Without both, a legal separation has not commenced.

**2. Absolute Divorce**

An absolute divorce is the complete legal dissolution of a marriage, allowing the parties to remarry. North Carolina law provides specific grounds and requirements for obtaining an absolute divorce.

- **Grounds:**
    
    - **One-Year Separation:** This is the most common ground for divorce in North Carolina. To qualify, the spouses must have lived separate and apart continuously for one year. Additionally, at least one of the parties must have resided in North Carolina for a minimum of six months immediately preceding the filing of the divorce action.1 The law specifies that the separation must have been for "at least a year and a day" before a complaint for divorce can be filed.1 Isolated incidents of sexual intercourse between the parties during the separation year will not necessarily stop the clock on the separation period, but a full resumption of marital relations would.11
    - **Incurable Insanity:** A less common ground for divorce involves the incurable insanity of one spouse. This requires the parties to have lived separate and apart for three consecutive years due to the incurable insanity of one spouse. Specific and stringent proof is required, typically involving evidence of institutionalization or a judicial finding of insanity, along with the testimony of at least two physicians, one of whom must be a psychiatrist, confirming the incurable nature of the insanity.9
- **No-Fault Principle:** For divorces based on one-year separation, North Carolina operates primarily as a no-fault state. This means that marital fault (such as adultery or abandonment) is not required to obtain the divorce itself.1 However, as will be discussed later, marital fault can have significant implications for alimony.
    
- **Residency Requirement:** A crucial prerequisite for filing for divorce in North Carolina is that at least one of the spouses must have been a resident of the state for a minimum of six months immediately before the divorce complaint is filed.1 The action is typically filed in the county where either the plaintiff or the defendant resides.11
    
- **Filing Process Overview:** The process of obtaining an absolute divorce typically involves filing several documents with the Clerk of Court. These include a Complaint (stating the facts and request for divorce), a Summons (to notify the other spouse), a Domestic Civil Action Cover Sheet, and an Affidavit pursuant to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) indicating whether the other spouse is in military service.1 A filing fee is also required, though it may be waived for indigent individuals. Proper legal service of the divorce papers on the other spouse is mandatory.1
    

**3. Separation Agreements**

While not required to _be_ legally separated, a Separation Agreement is a powerful and highly recommended tool for divorcing couples. A Separation Agreement is a private contract entered into by spouses who are separated or plan to separate imminently. Its purpose is to resolve various issues arising from the marital breakdown, such as the division of property and debts, spousal support (alimony and post-separation support), and, if applicable, child custody and child support.1

- **Requirements for Validity:** For a Separation Agreement to be legally valid and binding in North Carolina, it must meet specific formal requirements: it must be in writing, signed by both parties, and both signatures must be properly notarized (acknowledged before a certifying officer as defined in G.S. 52-10(b)).1 The certifying officer (notary) cannot be a party to the agreement.12
- **Scope:** These agreements can be comprehensive, addressing nearly all financial and parental matters.
- **Binding Nature:** Once validly executed, a Separation Agreement is generally a binding contract on the parties.8 However, it's important to note that provisions concerning child custody and child support always remain subject to modification by a court if it determines that the agreed terms are not in the child's best interest or if there has been a substantial change in circumstances warranting modification.1
- **Not Required for Divorce:** Executing a Separation Agreement does not make the process of obtaining the actual divorce decree easier or more difficult.8 Its value lies in settling substantive rights and obligations outside of court.

It is vital for individuals to understand the distinction between the _status_ of being legally separated and the _act_ of entering into a Separation Agreement. One can be legally separated simply by living apart with the requisite intent, without any formal paperwork.1 However, a Separation Agreement is a formal, written, and notarized legal document that defines the terms of the separation and settles important rights.1 The AI should clearly explain that while the former is a state of being, the latter is a contractual resolution, highly advisable for protecting one's interests and achieving clarity on complex issues. This distinction prevents individuals from mistakenly believing they need a signed agreement to start their one-year separation period or from underestimating the importance of formalizing agreed-upon terms.

**4. Divorce from Bed and Board (DBB)**

A Divorce from Bed and Board (DBB) is a legal action in North Carolina that is often misunderstood. Despite its name, a DBB is _not_ an absolute divorce; it is a form of court-ordered separation.1 Unlike the no-fault absolute divorce based on one-year separation, a DBB is fault-based. The spouse requesting a DBB must prove that the other spouse committed certain marital fault, such as abandonment, maliciously turning the other out of doors, cruel or barbarous treatment endangering life, offering indignities that render life intolerable, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs.1 Adultery can also be a ground.

If a DBB is granted, the court can address issues such as possession of the marital home, post-separation support, and child custody/support. However, the parties are still legally married. To obtain an absolute divorce, they must still meet the requirement of one year of physical separation (even if a DBB order is in place) and one party must meet the residency requirement before filing for an absolute divorce.1

|Separation Agreement Validity|Must be in writing, signed by both parties, and both signatures must be notarized (acknowledged before a certifying officer).|8|

**B. Equitable Distribution (ED): Dividing Marital and Divisible Property**

Upon the dissolution of a marriage, North Carolina law provides for the division of property through a process called "Equitable Distribution" (ED).

**1. Governing Principle**

North Carolina is an "equitable distribution" state, not a "community property" state. This distinction is crucial. In community property states, marital assets are typically divided exactly 50/50. In North Carolina, the law presumes that an equal (50/50) division of marital and divisible property is "equitable" or fair. However, this is a presumption, and a court can order an unequal division if it finds that an equal division would not be equitable under the specific circumstances of the case.3

**2. Classification of Property**

The first step in equitable distribution is to classify all property owned by the parties into one of three categories:

- **Marital Property:** This generally includes all real and personal property acquired by either spouse, or both spouses, during the marriage and _before_ the date of separation. This encompasses assets like the marital home, vehicles, bank accounts, investments, and furnishings acquired during the marriage. Importantly, it also includes debts created during the marriage. Vested pension and retirement benefits accrued between the date of marriage and the date of separation are also considered marital property. A gift from one spouse to the other _during_ the marriage is presumed to be marital property unless the donor spouse stated at the time of the conveyance that it was intended to be separate property.2 Marital property is valued as of the **date of separation**.3
- **Separate Property:** This category includes property that is not subject to equitable distribution. Separate property consists of:
    - All real and personal property owned by a spouse _before_ the marriage.
    - Property acquired by a spouse _during_ the marriage by inheritance (e.g., from a deceased relative) or by gift from a third party (e.g., a gift from parents to one spouse only).
    - Property acquired _after_ the date of separation with post-separation earnings or funds.
    - Income derived from separate property and appreciation of separate property, provided it has not been commingled with marital property in a way that loses its separate identity.
    - Property obtained in exchange for separate property.3
- **Divisible Property:** This is a unique category in North Carolina law designed to account for changes in the value of marital property and certain acquisitions that occur _after_ the date of separation but _before_ the date of distribution. Divisible property includes:
    - Post-separation increases and decreases in the value of marital property (e.g., a marital stock portfolio increasing in value after separation).
    - Property received after the date of separation that was acquired as a result of the marital efforts of either spouse _before_ the date of separation (e.g., a bonus earned during the marriage but paid after separation).
    - Passive income generated by marital property and received after the date of separation (e.g., rental income from a marital property).
    - Post-separation increases in marital debt. Divisible property, like marital property, is generally presumed to be divided equally. However, unlike marital property (valued at DOS), divisible property is valued as of the **time of trial or distribution**.3

The existence of these two distinct valuation dates—date of separation for marital property and date of trial/distribution for divisible property—introduces a layer of complexity into financial tracking and calculations. The value of assets can fluctuate significantly, especially if the divorce process is protracted. An AI assistant designed to help track case progress must be capable of prompting for and distinguishing between these values. For instance, it would need to solicit the value of a marital investment account as of the DOS, and then potentially an updated value for that same account (as its post-separation change in value would be divisible property) closer to the time of settlement or trial. Explaining _why_ these different dates are legally significant is crucial for user understanding.

A significant risk that can alter the character of property is "commingling." This occurs when separate property is mixed with marital property to such an extent that it loses its separate identity and becomes marital.4 For example, if one spouse inherits money (separate property) and deposits it into a joint marital bank account from which marital expenses are paid, that inherited money may become commingled and treated as marital property. Similarly, if marital funds are used to significantly improve or pay down a mortgage on a home that was owned by one spouse before the marriage, a portion of that home's value may become marital.4 The AI should be able to explain this concept and advise the user that if commingling is suspected, detailed financial tracing by a legal or financial professional is often necessary. Providing this information proactively can help users identify potential issues and protect their assets.

**3. Process of Equitable Distribution**

The ED process typically involves four key steps:

* Identification: Compiling a comprehensive list of all assets and debts owned by either or both parties.

* Classification: Determining whether each asset or debt is marital, separate, or divisible property.

* Valuation: Assigning a fair market value to each item of marital and divisible property as of the appropriate date (DOS for marital, date of distribution for divisible).

* Distribution: Dividing the net value of the marital and divisible property between the spouses in an equitable manner.

**4. Factors for Unequal Distribution (N.C.G.S. § 50-20(c))**

While an equal 50/50 split is presumed equitable, North Carolina General Statute § 50-20(c) lists numerous factors that a court must consider and can use as a basis for ordering an unequal division of marital and divisible property. These factors include, but are not limited to:

- The income, property, and liabilities of each party at the time the division of property is to become effective.
- Any obligation for support arising out of a prior marriage.
- The duration of the marriage.
- The age and physical and mental health of both parties.
- The need of a parent with custody of a child or children of the marriage to occupy or own the marital residence and to use or own its household effects.
- The expectation of pension, retirement, or other deferred compensation rights that are separate property.
- Any direct or indirect contribution made by one spouse to help educate or develop the career potential of the other...[source](https://www.findlaw.com/state/north-carolina-law/north-carolina-marital-property-laws.html) and the economic desirability of retaining such asset or interest intact and free from any claim or interference by the other party.
- The tax consequences to each party.
- Acts of either party to maintain, preserve, develop, or expand; or to waste, neglect, devalue or convert the marital property or divisible property, or both, during the period after separation of the parties and before the time of distribution.
- Any other factor which the court finds to be just and proper.2

It is important to note that marital misconduct, such as adultery, generally _does not_ directly affect the division of property in North Carolina. However, financial misconduct, such as one spouse hiding assets, wasting marital funds, or incurring debt for non-marital purposes, _can_ be a factor considered by the court in determining an equitable division.4

**5. Importance of Claiming ED Rights**

A critical point that the AI must emphasize repeatedly is that the right to equitable distribution is _not_ automatic. If claims for ED are not formally asserted by filing a lawsuit or resolved by a binding separation agreement _before_ an absolute divorce judgment is granted, those rights are permanently lost.1 This can have devastating financial consequences, as a spouse could lose any claim to marital assets acquired during the marriage.

**6. Resolution Methods**

Parties can resolve equitable distribution through several avenues:

- **Negotiation:** Directly between the parties or through their attorneys.
- **Separation Agreement:** A formal written contract detailing the property division.
- **Mediation:** A process involving a neutral third-party mediator to facilitate an agreement. In North Carolina, mediation is mandatory for equitable distribution cases before they can proceed to a court trial.4
- **Court Litigation:** If no agreement can be reached, a judge will decide the equitable distribution after a trial.

**Table 2: Key Factors for Equitable Distribution (N.C.G.S. § 50-20(c))**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Factor Category**|**Specific Factors Listed in Statute (Examples)**|**Governing Authority**|
|Economic Status & Resources|Income, property, liabilities of each party; obligations from prior marriage; expectation of separate retirement benefits; tax consequences; liquid/non-liquid nature of assets.|2|
|Contributions to Marriage/Property|Duration of marriage; contributions to education/career of other spouse; direct contributions to increase in value of separate property; efforts to acquire property.|3|
|Needs & Health|Age and physical/mental health of parties; need of custodial parent to occupy/own marital home.|3|
|Conduct Affecting Property|Acts to maintain/develop or waste/devalue marital/divisible property post-separation; difficulty of valuing business interests.|3|
|Other Equitable Considerations|Any other factor the court finds to be just and proper.|3|

**C. Spousal Support: Alimony and Post-Separation Support (PSS)**

Spousal support in North Carolina is designed to provide financial assistance from one spouse (the supporting spouse) to the other (the dependent spouse) following separation. There are two main types: Post-Separation Support (PSS) and Alimony.

**1. Definitions**

- **Post-Separation Support (PSS):** PSS is temporary financial support paid by the supporting spouse to the dependent spouse. It is intended to cover the dependent spouse's reasonable needs during the period after separation but _before_ a final order of alimony is entered or some other specified date in the PSS order occurs.1 PSS serves as a financial bridge until a more permanent determination on alimony can be made.
- **Alimony:** Alimony is spousal support that can be awarded for a longer duration, potentially indefinitely, or for a specified term. It can be paid periodically (e.g., monthly) or in a lump sum.5

The relationship between PSS and alimony is sequential. PSS addresses the immediate financial needs of a dependent spouse after separation. The determination of alimony involves a more comprehensive review of various factors and is intended to address longer-term support needs. The AI should clarify this two-stage approach, helping the user understand that PSS is an interim measure while the more complex issue of alimony is being resolved.

**2. Eligibility – The "Dependent Spouse" and "Supporting Spouse"**

To be eligible for either PSS or alimony, one spouse must be deemed a "dependent spouse" and the other a "supporting spouse."

- A **dependent spouse** is defined as a spouse, whether husband or wife, who is actually substantially dependent upon the other spouse for his or her maintenance and support, or is substantially in need of maintenance and support from the other spouse.5
- A **supporting spouse** is a spouse, whether husband or wife, upon whom the other spouse is actually substantially dependent for maintenance and support or from whom the other spouse is substantially in need of maintenance and support. The determination of dependency involves an examination of the parties' financial circumstances, needs, and accustomed standard of living during the marriage.

**3. Factors for PSS (N.C.G.S. § 50-16.2A(b))**

When deciding whether to award PSS and in what amount, the court considers several factors:

- The financial needs of the parties.
- The parties' accustomed standard of living.
- The present employment income and other recurring earnings of each party from any source.
- Their income-earning abilities.
- The separate and marital debt service obligations of each party.
- Those income-earning abilities.
- The separate and marital debt service obligations.
- The reasonably necessary expenses of each party.
- Each party's respective legal obligations to support any other persons.15 Importantly, the court _shall_ consider marital misconduct by the dependent spouse occurring prior to or on the date of separation when deciding PSS. If the judge considers the dependent spouse's misconduct, they _shall also_ consider any marital misconduct by the supporting spouse.15

**4. Factors for Alimony (N.C.G.S. § 50-16.3A(b))**

The determination of alimony is more complex and involves a broader range of factors, including:

- Marital misconduct of either spouse (discussed in detail below).
- The relative earnings and earning capacities of the spouses.
- The ages and the physical, mental, and emotional conditions of the spouses.
- The amount and sources of earned and unearned income of both spouses, including, but not limited to, earnings, dividends, and benefits such as medical, retirement, insurance, social security, or others.
- The duration of the marriage.
- The contribution by one spouse to the education, training, or increased earning power of the other spouse.
- The extent to which the earning power, expenses, or financial obligations of a spouse will be affected by reason of serving as the custodian of a minor child.
- The standard of living of the spouses established during the marriage.
- The relative education of the spouses and the time necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the spouse seeking alimony to find employment to meet his or her reasonable economic needs.
- The relative assets and liabilities of the spouses and the relative debt service requirements of the spouses, including legal obligations of support.
- The property brought to the marriage by either spouse.
- The contribution of a spouse as homemaker.
- The relative needs of the spouses.
- The federal, State, and local tax ramifications of the alimony award.2

**5. Marital Misconduct (Crucial Impact)**

Marital misconduct plays a uniquely powerful role in alimony determinations in North Carolina. "Marital misconduct" includes acts such as abandonment, maliciously turning the other out of doors, cruel or barbarous treatment, indignities rendering life intolerable, reckless spending of marital funds, excessive use of alcohol or drugs, and, most significantly, "illicit sexual behavior".13 "Illicit sexual behavior" is defined by statute (N.C.G.S. § 50-16.1A(3)a) as "acts of sexual or deviate sexual intercourse, deviate sexual acts, or sexual acts defined in G.S. 14-27.20(4), voluntarily engaged in by a spouse with someone other than the other spouse."

The consequences of proven illicit sexual behavior on an alimony claim are stark and often outcome-determinative:

- If the court finds that the **dependent spouse** participated in an act of illicit sexual behavior during the marriage and prior to or on the date of separation, the court **shall not** award alimony.13 This is an absolute bar, regardless of the dependent spouse's financial need or the supporting spouse's ability to pay.
- If the court finds that the **supporting spouse** participated in an act of illicit sexual behavior during the marriage and prior to or on the date of separation, and the dependent spouse did _not_, then the court **shall** order that alimony be paid to the dependent spouse.13 This creates a mandate for an alimony award.
- If the court finds that _both_ the dependent spouse and the supporting spouse participated in acts of illicit sexual behavior, then alimony is awarded or denied in the discretion of the judge based on all the circumstances.14

While many alimony factors allow for judicial discretion and a balancing of equities, the rules regarding illicit sexual behavior are notably binary. The AI must clearly highlight this powerful effect, explaining the specific definition of illicit sexual behavior and emphasizing that proof of such conduct can drastically alter financial outcomes in alimony cases. This is a critical piece of information for any individual navigating a North Carolina divorce where such conduct is a factor.

Marital misconduct is also considered for PSS, though its impact is discretionary rather than an absolute bar or mandate as with alimony and illicit sexual behavior.15

**6. Amount and Duration**

Unlike child support, there are no presumptive guidelines or mathematical formulas for determining the amount or duration of PSS or alimony in North Carolina.13 The awards are based on the judge's discretion after considering all relevant statutory factors. Alimony can be ordered as a lump sum or in periodic payments, for a specified term or an indefinite period. Alimony typically terminates upon the death of either party, the remarriage of the dependent spouse, or the cohabitation of the dependent spouse with another adult in a marriage-like relationship, or on a date specified in the court order or separation agreement.5

**7. Importance of Claiming Rights**

Similar to equitable distribution, rights to PSS and alimony are permanently lost if they are not asserted in a court pleading or resolved by a separation agreement _before_ the judgment of absolute divorce is entered.1 This is another critical warning the AI must deliver.

**8. Modification**

Court-ordered alimony that is paid periodically may be modified or terminated upon a showing of a substantial change in circumstances by either party (e.g., significant change in income, job loss, retirement).5 However, if alimony terms are set forth in a separation agreement that is not incorporated into a court order, or if the agreement explicitly states alimony is non-modifiable, then modification may not be possible through the courts. PSS is temporary by its nature and generally not subject to modification in the same way as long-term alimony, as it is intended to bridge a short period.

**Table 3: Comparison of Post-Separation Support (PSS) and Alimony in NC**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Feature**|**Post-Separation Support (PSS)**|**Alimony**|
|**Purpose**|Temporary support to meet dependent spouse's reasonable needs after separation, before alimony determination.|Longer-term support to provide for a dependent spouse.|
|**Duration**|Temporary; until date specified in PSS order, or an order awarding/denying alimony is entered.|Can be for a specified term, indefinitely, or lump sum. Terminates on death, remarriage/cohabitation of recipient, or by agreement/order.|
|**Key Eligibility**|Dependent spouse with inadequate resources to meet needs; supporting spouse has ability to pay.|Dependent spouse; supporting spouse has ability to pay. Considers numerous statutory factors.|
|**Impact of Misconduct**|Marital misconduct by either spouse _shall_ be considered by the judge in deciding whether to award and the amount. 15|Illicit sexual behavior by dependent spouse _bars_ alimony. Illicit sexual behavior by supporting spouse (if dependent is innocent) _mandates_ alimony. Other misconduct is a factor. 13|
|**Modifiability (if court-ordered)**|Generally not modified as it is short-term; new alimony order supersedes.|May be modified upon a substantial change of circumstances, unless non-modifiable by agreement.|
|**Governing Statute (Primary)**|N.C.G.S. § 50-16.2A|N.C.G.S. § 50-16.3A|

**D. Children's Matters: Custody and Visitation**

When a marriage with minor children ends, determining custody and visitation arrangements is often one of the most contentious and emotionally charged aspects.

**1. "Best Interest of the Child" Standard**

In North Carolina, all decisions regarding child custody and visitation are governed by a single, overriding principle: the "best interest of the child".6 This standard grants judges broad discretion to weigh various factors to determine an arrangement that will best promote the child's welfare and happiness.

The "best interest" standard is intentionally broad, allowing judges to consider any factor relevant to the child's well-being. While common factors are outlined in statutes and case law, the specific weight given to each factor and the ultimate decision can vary significantly based on the unique facts presented in each case. The AI must convey that predicting custody outcomes with certainty is difficult due to this judicial discretion and the fact-intensive nature of these proceedings. It should encourage users to document their positive involvement in their children's lives across various domains (caregiving, education, health, activities).

**2. Types of Custody**

North Carolina law recognizes two primary types of custody 16:

- **Legal Custody:** This refers to the right and responsibility to make major decisions regarding the child's upbringing. These decisions typically involve issues related to the child's education, healthcare (including mental health), and religious training. Legal custody can be awarded solely to one parent or jointly to both parents. Joint legal custody means both parents share the decision-making authority.
- **Physical Custody:** This refers to the parent with whom the child will primarily live and who will provide the day-to-day care. Physical custody can also be sole (primary physical custody with one parent, with the other parent having visitation) or joint. Joint physical custody implies that both parents have the child for significant periods, though it does not necessarily mandate an exact 50/50 division of time. The court will determine a schedule that is in the child's best interest.

It is possible for a court to order joint legal and joint physical custody, where both parents share decision-making and the child spends substantial time in each parent's care.

**3. Factors Considered for "Best Interest"**

When determining what is in a child's best interest, a judge may consider a wide array of factors, including but not limited to 16:

- Who has been the primary caregiver, providing day-to-day care for the child (e.g., feeding, bathing, dressing).
- The interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or her parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interest.
- Each parent's capacity to provide love, affection, and guidance.
- Each parent's ability to provide the child with food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and a safe environment.
- The child's adjustment to his or her home, school, and community.
- The mental and physical health of all individuals involved.
- The child's preference, if the child is of sufficient age and maturity to express a reasoned preference (there is no set age, it is up to the judge's discretion).
- Evidence of domestic violence. Acts of domestic violence are a significant factor and can heavily influence custody and visitation arrangements.16 Family law judges are specifically tasked with hearing domestic violence cases 17, indicating the seriousness with which the courts view such allegations. If a user indicates the presence of domestic violence, the AI should strongly advise them to seek immediate legal counsel and assistance from domestic violence support organizations, as this can lead to restrictions on custody or visitation, such as supervised visitation, to ensure the child's safety.
- Each parent's willingness to promote a positive relationship between the child and the other parent.
- Any other factor the court deems relevant to the child's well-being.

**4. Visitation**

Visitation (sometimes referred to as "parenting time") is the time awarded to the parent who does not have primary physical custody to spend with the child. Visitation schedules can vary widely depending on the circumstances, including the child's age, the distance between the parents' homes, and the work schedules of the parents. Schedules may include regular weekend visits, midweek visits, shared holidays, and extended time during school breaks and summer vacations.16 It is a common misconception that visitation can be denied if the non-custodial parent fails to pay child support. However, North Carolina law is clear that visitation rights and child support obligations are separate issues; one cannot be withheld due to non-compliance with the other.16

**5. Jurisdiction ("Home State Rule")**

For a North Carolina court to have the authority (jurisdiction) to make an initial child custody determination, it generally must be the "home state" of the child. Under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), adopted by North Carolina, the home state is typically the state where the child has lived with a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of the custody proceeding. If the child is less than six months old, the home state is usually the state where the child has lived from birth. There are more complex rules if a child has recently moved or if no state qualifies as the home state.16

**6. Mediation**

In North Carolina, mediation is a mandatory step in contested child custody cases before the case can proceed to a trial before a judge.16 Parties are required to attend a mediation session with a neutral, court-appointed mediator. The goal of mediation is to help the parents reach their own mutually acceptable agreement on custody and visitation, known as a "Parenting Agreement."

**7. Parenting Agreements**

If parents reach an agreement in mediation or through direct negotiation, their terms can be formalized into a written Parenting Agreement. If signed by both parties and the judge, this agreement becomes a legally binding court order.

**8. Modification**

Child custody and visitation orders are not necessarily permanent. They can be modified by the court if there has been a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child since the entry of the last order, and if a modification is in the child's best interest.

**E. Financial Obligations for Children: Child Support**

Both parents have a legal duty to financially support their minor children. North Carolina has established guidelines to determine the amount of child support one parent may be required to pay to the other.

**1. Governing Principle: Income Shares Model**

North Carolina uses the "Income Shares Model" to calculate child support.18 This model is based on the concept that children should receive the same proportion of parental income that they would have received if their parents lived together. Essentially, the model calculates the total amount that would typically be spent on the children in an intact family with the parents' combined income and then prorates this amount between the parents based on their respective shares of that combined income.

**2. NC Child Support Guidelines**

The North Carolina Conference of Chief District Judges has established presumptive Child Support Guidelines. These guidelines must be applied in all cases involving child support unless the court finds that applying the guidelines would not meet or would exceed the reasonable needs of the child, or would be otherwise unjust or inappropriate.18 If the court deviates from the guidelines, it must make specific written findings explaining its reasons. The guidelines generally apply to parents whose combined adjusted gross income is $40,000 per month ($480,000 per year) or less.18 For incomes above this threshold, the court sets support in an amount that meets the reasonable needs of the child for health, education, and maintenance, considering the parties' estates, earnings, conditions, and accustomed standard of living.18

**3. Calculation (Worksheets)**

Child support is calculated using one of three specific worksheets (Worksheet A, B, or C). The choice of worksheet depends primarily on the custody arrangement, specifically the number of overnights the children spend with each parent annually.18

- **Worksheet A** is used when one parent has primary physical custody of all children for whom support is being determined (meaning the children reside with that parent for 243 nights or more per year).
- **Worksheet B** is used when parents share joint physical custody (meaning each parent has the children for at least 123 overnights per year and assumes financial responsibility during that time) or when one parent has primary custody of some children and parents share custody of others.
- **Worksheet C** is used in cases of split custody, where each parent has primary physical custody of at least one child.

This direct link between the number of overnights in the parenting schedule and the child support calculation is significant. It means that negotiations or court decisions regarding the physical custody schedule have a direct and calculable financial impact on the child support obligation. The AI should explain this interrelationship, as individuals may not immediately recognize how closely these two issues are intertwined.

The calculation on the worksheets considers several key financial inputs:

- Each parent's **gross monthly income** (from virtually any source, with specific statutory inclusions and exclusions).18
- The number of **overnights** the children spend with each parent.
- Reasonable **work-related child care costs** paid by either parent.
- The cost of **health insurance premiums** paid for the children.
- **Extraordinary expenses** (e.g., expenses for special or private schooling to meet particular educational needs, or expenses for transporting the child between parents' homes, if found reasonable and necessary).18
- **Pre-existing child support obligations** for other children that a parent is legally required to pay under a court order or agreement.
- A parent's **financial responsibility for other natural or adopted children** residing with them (not the children involved in the current action).

**4. Income Definition**

"Income" for child support purposes is broadly defined as a parent's actual gross income from any source. This includes salary, wages, bonuses, commissions, dividends, severance pay, rental income, retirement/pension income, interest, trust income, capital gains, Social Security benefits (except those received for the child due to a parent's disability, which are treated specially), workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, and alimony received from someone other than the other parent in the current action.18 Certain means-tested public assistance benefits (like TANF or SSI) are excluded from income. If a parent is found to be voluntarily unemployed or underemployed in bad faith to evade their support obligation, the court can impute income to that parent based on their earning capacity.18

The comprehensive nature of "income" and the various allowable adjustments (like for other children supported) mean that accurate financial disclosure is crucial for a correct child support calculation. Simply using a base salary figure might lead to an inaccurate estimation. The AI should prompt the user for a wide range of financial data and explain why these details are necessary for an accurate understanding of potential child support. This also underscores the importance of honesty and thoroughness in financial disclosures during the legal process.

**5. Duration**

Child support obligations in North Carolina generally continue until a child reaches the age of 18. However, if the child is still enrolled in primary or secondary school when they turn 18, support continues until the child graduates, ceases to attend school on a regular basis, fails to make satisfactory academic progress, or reaches age 20, whichever comes first. Support obligations may extend beyond these limits for a child who is physically or mentally disabled and incapable of self-support. While parents can agree in a separation agreement to contribute to college expenses, a North Carolina court typically cannot order a parent to pay for college.8

**6. Modification**

A child support order can be modified if there is a showing of a "substantial change in circumstances." For orders that are at least three years old, a difference of 15% or more between the amount of the existing order and the amount that would result from applying the current guidelines based on current incomes and circumstances is presumed to be a substantial change of circumstances warranting modification.18

**7. Tax Implications**

Under current federal tax law, child support payments are not tax-deductible by the paying parent, nor are they considered taxable income to the receiving parent. This is different from the tax treatment of alimony (for agreements pre-2019 or if specified).
