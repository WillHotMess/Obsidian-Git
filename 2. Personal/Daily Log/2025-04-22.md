## Summary of Microsoft Cost Management Updates (April 2025): Capabilities and Use Cases

**Enhanced Exports (Generally Available)**

Microsoft has released several enhancements to the Cost Management Exports feature, now generally available across all Azure regions and clouds. The key updates focus on expanding data types, improving file handling, supporting industry standards, and streamlining workflows.

### Core Capabilities

- **Expanded Data Export:**  
  Users can now export a broader set of datasets, including:
  - Price sheets
  - Reservation recommendations
  - Reservation details
  - Reservation transactions  
  These are in addition to the standard cost and usage data (both actual and amortized)[2][3][11].

- **Support for FOCUS (FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification):**  
  Data exports can now use the FOCUS format, an open-source standard that normalizes cost and usage data across cloud providers. This format combines actual and amortized costs, potentially reducing storage requirements and simplifying multi-cloud reporting[2][3][8].

- **Flexible File Handling:**  
  Exported data can be delivered in CSV or Parquet formats, with compression options for efficiency. The system supports file partitioning (breaking large datasets into smaller files) and file overwrite (updating daily exports with new data)[2][8][11].

- **Enterprise Security and Compliance:**  
  Exports can be directed to Azure storage accounts protected by firewalls, supporting organizational security and compliance needs[2][8][11].

- **Streamlined Export Creation:**  
  The user interface has been updated to allow configuration of multiple exports for different datasets in a single workflow. Users can select schema versions for compatibility and rerun export jobs for historical data without creating new one-time exports[2][8][11].

- **API Enhancements:**  
  A new version of the API is available, enabling programmatic management of export configurations and operations[2][3].

### Use Cases

- **FinOps and Cost Reporting:**  
  Organizations can automate the export of detailed cost and usage data for integration with external analytics, reporting tools, or custom dashboards, supporting FinOps practices[8][11].

- **Multi-Cloud Cost Management:**  
  With FOCUS support, organizations managing costs across multiple cloud providers can standardize and normalize their reporting, improving cross-cloud visibility and analysis[2][8].

- **Data Processing and Storage Optimization:**  
  File partitioning and compression features help manage large datasets efficiently, reducing download times and storage/network costs[8][11].

- **Security-Conscious Data Management:**  
  Exporting directly to storage accounts behind firewalls ensures sensitive cost data remains protected and compliant with organizational policies[2][11].

- **Historical Analysis and Backfilling:**  
  The ability to rerun exports for past periods enables organizations to backfill data for audits, trend analysis, or to recover from missed exports[8][20].

| CSV/Parquet Formats & Compression    | Flexible, efficient data delivery options                                                               |
| Secure Export to Firewalled Storage  | Maintains data security and compliance                                                                  |
| Streamlined UI & API                 | Simplifies export setup and management, supports automation                                             |
| Historical Data Export               | Enables backfilling and retrospective analysis                                                          |

These enhancements are designed to support organizations in automating, securing, and optimizing their Azure cost management workflows, particularly for those with advanced FinOps requirements or multi-cloud environments[2][3][8][11].
