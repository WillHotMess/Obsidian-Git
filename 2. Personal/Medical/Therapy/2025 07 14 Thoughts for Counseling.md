Opening Context
	•	Acknowledge this time apart has given me clarity
	•	Not here to blame, but to be honest about what I’ve learned about myself
	•	Want to explore if there’s a path forward or if we should focus on co-parenting
1. Life Engagement & Energy Mismatch
The Pattern:
	•	Constant “Are you okay?” questions
	•	Always melancholy responses (headache, tired, don’t feel well)
	•	Content with existing vs. building infrastructure
	•	TikTok/Netflix for hours vs. pursuing growth
My Realization:
	•	I’ve been judgmental about this - I own that
	•	I need a partner with drive and initiative
	•	Can’t be everything to one person
	•	Need someone building their own “infrastructure for wholeness”
The Question:
	•	Is this depression/anxiety you want to work on?
	•	Or is this just who you are and want to be?
	•	Because if it’s the latter, we’re incompatible
2. The Villain Narrative
The Hurt:
	•	You’ve rewritten our 11 years as toxic/abusive
	•	Public social media posts about being in toxic relationship
	•	Telling friends/therapist I’m the villain
	•	Meanwhile I still protect your reputation
The Impact:
	•	How can you go from hero to villain so quickly in your mind?
	•	Hurts that someone I love paints such a terrible picture of me
	•	Mutual friends validate that I’m a good person with good intentions
The Boundary:
	•	“I can’t get back with somebody who thinks I’m a villain”
	•	If you don’t see me as good-hearted person, why would you want me back?
	•	Why would I run toward someone who thinks I’m toxic?
3. The Safety Issue - Walking Away
What Broke:
	•	When you left, something in me broke
	•	I believe marriages don’t just give up and leave
	•	This goes against everything I stand for about commitment
What I Need:
	•	Assurance this will never happen again
	•	Commitment that when things get tough, we face them together
	•	Can’t go back without knowing you won’t just run away again
4. The Bottom Line Questions
For Reconciliation to Be Possible:
	•	Do you want to build infrastructure and engage with life?
	•	Can you see me as a good person who loves you?
	•	Will you commit to working through problems instead of leaving?
If Not:
	•	That’s okay - we’re just different people
	•	Let’s focus on healthy co-parenting
	•	No shame in being incompatible
Key Phrases to Remember:
	•	“Infrastructure for wholeness”
	•	“I can’t get back with somebody who thinks I’m a villain”
	•	“Something in me broke when you left”
	•	“Are we just different people who want different things?”
