What I have come to realize in the past few days is this...

Hannah has always had a tendency toward depression, anxiety, and negative self-worth. We have been together for 11 years, and this has been standard. This also leads to a lethargy, and low motivation that wears on me. I when I went into my 30s I had this assumption that we were going to switch into high gear and it's why I was so intent on waiting until I was 30 to have a child. Our 20s were for up leveling traveling having fun and getting to a comfortable position so that when we had a child a mortgage and all those things we could switch into gear and it'd be less fun and you just grind through it I watched both of my parents a lot of our friends my sister a lot of people go through their 30s and 40s grinding through with kids and things that they had to take care of and on the other side of it you get to a more comfortable place. With Hannah I continue to see a lack of motivation she doesn't want to go be social she doesn't want to push forward in her career she doesn't want to go find hobbies or challenge yourself to be active her mode of operation is that she wants to lay in bed scroll through tiktok with Netflix in the background do simple work and just be a bit of a slug and she's unapologetic about this this is how she wants to operate and. She will use her parents as an example and she'll say you know they just like to chill and I just like to chill but the difference is her father spent over 20 years as a drill Sergeant in the military and he ran multiple iron man's he has had his career and his life he raised three children and he's on the other side of that now so it's not a fair comparison her stepmother is traveling all over the southeast with her company and on calls all day long she's not relaxing it's not a fair comparison. And so it doesn't surprise me if Hannah feels that I don't feel she's doing enough or that I don't value what she brings to this relationship I can understand that she might be sensing that because I don't want to be around somebody who is OK just existing i need a co adult i need a co-parent who I feel is .
