# Therapy Session Recap

## Current Status

William and his therapist are checking in after the Easter holiday during his separation from Hannah. The relationship feels "stuck" with no clear path forward.

## Major Developments Since Last Session

**Holiday Awkwardness**: Hannah told her family about their separation without discussing it with William first, creating an uncomfortable family gathering.

**Ongoing Communication Issues**: William reports having several uncomfortable conversations with Hannah where he's tried to acknowledge his faults and reflect on needed changes, but feels like he's not getting any positive response.

**Hannah's Current State**: William perceives Hannah as "done" and unsure what she wants from the relationship moving forward.

## Key Therapeutic Insights

### The "Filter" Problem
William describes Hannah consistently misinterpreting his words and intentions, putting them through a negative lens. The therapist explains this as likely stemming from:

- Unresolved past hurts that have been "churning in the background" for years
- Internal narratives Hannah has created about William's intentions
- These narratives getting reinforced over time, making her resistant to believing his explanations

### Background Context Explored
**Hannah's Struggles**:
- Long-standing self-worth and confidence issues
- Significant trauma history, including difficult relationship with her father
- Postpartum depression after Miller's birth
- Recent major life stressors (move, job loss, Miller's autism diagnosis)

**William's Background**:
- Parents divorced when he was young, but had "four loving parents"
- Frequent moves and school changes as a child
- Father was emotionally distant workaholic
- Became highly driven and goal-oriented, especially after meeting Hannah
- Now feels pressure as primary breadwinner with mounting responsibilities

## Current Relationship Dynamics

**The Stress Cycle**: William acknowledges he's been difficult to be around due to work stress and daily pressures (long commutes for Miller's school, financial pressure, etc.)

**Score-Keeping**: Hannah keeps track of household contributions, which frustrates William given their different work situations and income levels

**Lack of Connection Time**: Both acknowledge they've lost intentional couple time due to parenting responsibilities and stress

## Therapeutic Direction

The therapist is helping William understand:
- This isn't just about communication skills - there are deeper attachment wounds at play
- Both partners need to work on creating safety in the relationship
- Hannah's responses likely stem from protective mechanisms rather than deliberate harm
- The parallel between William's childhood experience with his father and how Hannah might be experiencing him now

## Key Takeaway

This session establishes that their issues go much deeper than surface-level communication problems - they're dealing with trauma responses, unhealed attachment wounds, and the accumulated stress of major life changes, all requiring both individual and couples work to address.

## Core Issues Identified

**Communication Breakdown**: There's a deeply entrenched pattern where Hannah interprets your words and actions through what seems like a negative filter, attributing meanings you say you didn't intend. Your therapist astutely identifies this as likely stemming from unresolved past hurts that have created internal narratives over years.

**Unhealed Attachment Wounds**: Hannah appears to be operating from a place of deep-seated trauma and low self-worth that predates your relationship but has been significantly activated by recent stressors. Her protective mechanisms are preventing her from seeing changes you feel you've made.

**Cumulative Stress Overload**: The perfect storm of major life changes - IVF, difficult pregnancy, cross-country move, loss of support system, Hannah's job loss, Miller's autism diagnosis, and your intense work pressure - has overwhelmed both your systems.

## What Stands Out

Your therapist is skillfully helping you understand that Hannah's seemingly "unreasonable" responses likely stem from trauma responses rather than deliberate attempts to hurt you. The way she's bringing up 5-6 year old arguments suggests she's been internally processing unresolved hurts without addressing them directly.

Your background - particularly your experience with an emotionally distant, workaholic father - seems to be creating an unconscious parallel where Hannah may be experiencing you as unavailable despite your best intentions to be different.

## The Therapeutic Direction

The therapist is establishing that this will require work from both partners - you can't single-handedly fix communication patterns rooted in trauma responses, but you can learn to create more safety in how you approach difficult conversations.

This feels like the beginning of understanding that underneath the surface conflicts about household tasks and communication are much deeper issues around safety, attachment, and feeling valued in the relationship.
