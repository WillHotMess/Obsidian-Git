Quick update on Reddit Ads.

I have setup an account with my Pickleball Journal email. 

The current promotion, is a match of $500 in ad credits for $500 spent. If we spread this spend out across 50-60 days, the estimated impressions would be 12k-22.9k, and 60-114 clicks **daily.** 

We would target: 
- r/ Pickleball
- r/ Pickleball_teaching
- r/ Pickleballreview

_ROI calculated on $4.99/month subscription LTV vs $1,000 total ad spend_

## Strategic Rationale

**Why Reddit Works for Us:**

- **Audience Alignment:** Our core personas (data-driven newcomers, competitive intermediates) are active in these communities
- **Engagement Quality:** High-intent users seeking pickleball improvement and equipment advice
- **Cost Efficiency:** The 50% credit match significantly improves our customer acquisition economics

**Risk Mitigation:**

- **Conservative Target:** 3% conversion delivers 102% ROI by month 3
- **Early Monitoring:** Daily performance tracking allows quick optimization or exit
- **Proven Model:** Subscription LTV provides predictable payback timeline

## Recommendation

**Proceed with full $1,000 campaign.** The risk-adjusted upside is compelling, and the 50% credit match provides a significant buffer. Even at conservative 3% conversion rates, we achieve strong positive ROI within one quarter.
