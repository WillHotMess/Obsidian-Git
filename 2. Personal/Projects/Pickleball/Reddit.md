Quick update on Reddit Ads.

I have setup an account with my Pickleball Journal email. 

The current promotion, is a match of $500 in ad credits for $500 spent. If we spread this spend out across 50-60 days, the estimated impressions would be 12k-22.9k, and 60-114 clicks **daily.** 

We would target: 
- r/ Pickleball
- r/ Pickleball_teaching
- r/ Pickleballreview

What does ROI look like assuming CTR converts to sign-ups?
