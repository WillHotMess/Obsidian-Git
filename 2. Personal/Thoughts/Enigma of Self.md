What is the next chapter for me?
Father? Of course. 
Hard worker? Of course? 
But how do I fall out of love with what I always have loved? 

Live music. Being irrational. Nights that keep spinning forward, with a drink in hand. A marble in the plinko board. Drinking. Socializing. Being me. Being who I am. 

When I remember the nights I hardly remember. I felt so alone in it all. A room around me, socially insulated by choice. Put me in front of anyone, I will leave a mark. Let me run my own show, I would prefer to have my headphones on. Like all those days with earphones on in crowded coffee shops. 

Being with people, I really wanted to feel together, but not a part of it. It is the same with my running group as it was at college parties. Drinking makes this easier. But it is avoidant. 

This marks the last few years of my marriage. Around, but not together. This is my fault, I act as though life is my movie, and everyone else is here to fuel what I am running toward. 

I am a puzzle piece that wants to be in a box. But, not in a box that fits. I would rather round out my edges and cut new holes to make a match. It’s not real; I am not sure it ever has been. 

Ultimately, there is no joy in this. But there is fleeting comfort. 

I should really examine why this intimacy is so hard for me.Why I feel so robotic. Ultimately, I do deserve more than just hearing myself talk.
