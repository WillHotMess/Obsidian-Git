Something does need to break. 
It is not okay to be so callous with your own health, and the lives that rely on you. Being in *limbo* is not a fair or acceptable excuse for belligerence. The stakes are so much higher and you made it out largely unscathed; less a failed marriage. 

Mind > Instant Gratification 
*“I wouldn’t trade one silly mistake for another 5 years of life”*  But… not really.  Your real desire is routine. Stability. Accession. Now is the time to slow down to speed up. You have a break in the ocean, no need to let the waters flood in again. 

**What does it take?**
Well, you’ve spent years surrounding yourself to the people that drive poor decisions.  Name ‘em I dare you: Stephen, Peter, Damien, Scott, Jonny, and I could keep going. Your brain thanks you for the damage you’ve done; your liver as well. 

It’s not regret, it’s re-examination.
Here’s to the new year. December could be a different month. Hunker down, go dry, Slow the meds - cut the drinking - enjoy the quietness of the business world grinding to a halt. Focus on Miller. Focus on the gym. Focus on focusing. 

Examine what you really mean when you say you really mean things
Do you really not want to be someone’s whole world?  Because if so, there is danger in moving quickly, 
Do you really want to surround yourself with driven, successful people? If so, there is danger in volatility. 
Are you still healing? If so, what does your heart need - and how do you get it? 

Unfortunately, none of this is easy. It was never going to be, and it probably wont ever be. 
On the other side of this, is there a version of self that you deserve? If so, what is it? Can you even express it? 

Ask yourself this… do want to do this again in 10 years?  Of course not. **Okay, so then how do ensure you never get to this place again?**

1. Your twenties are behind you. A fond farewell.
2. The curse of divorce is a gift of opportunity. Use it wisely.
3. Be relentless in your own transformation. This cannot be cyclical.
