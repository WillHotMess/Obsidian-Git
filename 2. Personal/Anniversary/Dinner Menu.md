### Main Course: Pepper-Crusted Filet Mignon with Red Wine Reduction

**Ingredients:**
- 2 filet mignon steaks (5-6 oz each, about 1½ inches thick)
- 3 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
- Coarse salt
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- ½ cup balsamic vinegar
- ¼ cup red wine (preferably a full-bodied red like Cabernet Sauvignon)
- ½ cup beef broth

**Instructions:**
1. Remove steaks from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature.
2. Place peppercorns in a baking sheet and crush them using the bottom of a heavy skillet.

9. When balsamic begins to bubble, reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 3 minutes until reduced by half.
10. Add red wine and beef broth, simmer for 5-8 minutes until sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.
11. Remove steaks from oven, let rest for 3-5 minutes before serving.

4. Stir in vanilla extract and salt; set aside to cool slightly.
5. Beat egg yolks with 2 tablespoons of sugar until thick and pale yellow (3-4 minutes).
6. Gently fold chocolate mixture into egg yolks; set aside.
7. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar until soft peaks form.
8. Gradually add remaining sugar while beating until stiff, glossy peaks form.
9. Fold ⅓ of egg whites into chocolate mixture to lighten it.
10. Gently fold in remaining egg whites in two additions.
11. Divide mixture among prepared ramekins, filling to the top.
12. Run your finger around the inside edge of each ramekin (this helps soufflés rise evenly).
