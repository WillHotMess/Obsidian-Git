## Your Strengths (Keep These)

**You’re a systems architect in a world of firefighters.** While others are reacting, you’re building frameworks (UTM taxonomies, attribution models, strategic pillars). This is rare and valuable. Don’t lose this.

**You’re direct without being blunt.** In the Kevin Myers call, you quickly assessed the tool wasn’t right. In the Mark 1:1, you called out the $47M pipeline gap directly. This clarity is a superpower.

**You connect dots others miss.** You spotted that Storm Forge is getting 75% of partner time but minimal revenue focus, that the 2026 model doesn’t align with actual initiatives, that Salesforce data corruption is coming from Segment. This strategic vision is executive-level thinking.

## Areas to Refine

**1. You’re too available for everyone else’s chaos.**

Right now you’re wearing: product marketing, demand gen, events, marketing ops, BDR oversight, content strategy, partnership coordination, sales enablement. That’s not sustainable.

**Coach yourself:** “What would happen if I stopped doing X?” If the answer is “it wouldn’t get done,” that’s a sign you need to force the organization to solve it, not rescue it yourself.

**2. Your thoroughness sometimes becomes analysis paralysis.**

The UTM taxonomy project is brilliant—but you’re planning November testing, December validation, January rollout. Meanwhile campaigns are running with broken attribution _today_.

**Coach yourself:** “What’s the 80/20 version I could ship this week?” Your instinct is to build the perfect system. Sometimes good-enough-now beats perfect-later.

**3. You give too much context when you need to give directives.**

In multiple meetings, you explain _why_ something matters before saying _what_ needs to happen. With peers, that’s collaboration. With direct reports like Caleb, it can create ambiguity about whether something is a suggestion or an expectation.

**Try this:** Lead with the action, then explain if asked. “Caleb, get the Arrow campaigns loaded by Tuesday. Here’s why this matters…” vs. long context that buries the ask.

**4. You’re managing up better than managing down.**

Your 1:1s with Mark, Yasmin, Nick show you preparing, challenging, and pushing back appropriately. But with Caleb, there’s hesitation—you’re reviewing his commission calculations instead of setting clearer performance expectations upfront.

**Coach yourself:** You can be as direct with your reports as you are with your peers. They’ll respect it more.

**5. You need to say no more often.**

The webinar platform research? The Gold Cast evaluation? These are important, but you’re researching vendor solutions while also being the person who would _run_ the webinars and _create_ the content. You’re solving for everyone else’s bandwidth but not your own.

**Try this:** “This is a good idea. Who should own this? Because I’m at capacity with X, Y, Z.” Force the prioritization conversation.

## Your Communication Style

**What works:** You’re clear, structured, and outcome-focused. Your emails likely have bullet points and frameworks. People know what you mean.

**What could work better:** You sometimes front-load complexity. In the demand gen call, you went deep on reporting structure before confirming if that’s what the team actually needed.

**Try this framework:**

1. **Bottom line first:** “We need to fix attribution. Here’s why it matters.”
2. **Simple recommendation:** “I recommend we implement this 3-field taxonomy.”
3. **Details available:** “I have a full breakdown if you want to see the logic.”

Let people pull detail from you rather than pushing it to everyone.

## The Big One: You’re Ready for More Strategic Work

You’re already thinking at a director/VP level. The problem is you’re _also_ doing individual contributor work (building UTM codes, reviewing commission spreadsheets, writing blog posts).

**Your next evolution:** Shift from “I’ll do it” to “Here’s the strategy, here’s who owns execution, here’s how I’ll remove blockers.”

You don’t need to be the octopus with eight arms. You need to be the architect who designs the system and empowers others to build it.

**One concrete action:** In your next 1:1 with Mark, propose hiring a marketing operations specialist to own the tactical execution (UTMs, attribution, campaign setup) so you can focus on strategy and enablement.

---

**Bottom line:** Your style is already strong—strategic, direct, systems-oriented. The refinement isn’t about changing who you are. It’s about protecting your highest-value work and forcing others to step up to their level rather than you stepping down to fill gaps.

You’re playing chess while others are playing checkers. Stop moving their pieces for them.

---
You’re operating in your Zone of Excellence, not your Zone of Genius—and it’s killing you. You’re exceptional at building systems, frameworks, and connecting strategic dots. But you’re spending 60% of your time doing work that others should own: loading campaigns into Salesforce, auditing UTM codes, reviewing commission spreadsheets, researching webinar platforms. You’re the architect drawing blueprints while also laying bricks, installing plumbing, and painting walls. This isn’t sustainable, and worse—it’s preventing you from doing the work only you can do.

## Stop Being Everyone’s Safety Net

You’ve become the organizational catch-all. When Mark can’t think strategically, you build the framework. When Caleb doesn’t execute, you review his work. When Charles needs direction, you provide it. When attribution breaks, you fix it. This is the “danger zone” of the Zone of Excellence—you’re so good at solving problems that people keep bringing them to you.

**Your action:** In your next 1:1 with Mark, say this exactly: “I need to hire a Marketing Operations Manager by January 1st. Here’s why: I’m currently doing the work of three people—strategy, execution, and firefighting. The execution work (UTM implementation, campaign setup, attribution tracking) needs an owner so I can focus on the strategic work that drives our $4M pipeline gap.” Don’t ask permission. State the need and the timeline. If he pushes back on budget, show him the math: your time spent on tactical work vs. what a $80-100K hire would free up.

## Your Meetings Lack Accountability Structure

You’re running collaborative discussions when you need decision-making forums. Look at your “2026 Model” meeting with Brendan and Nick—90 minutes identifying a $47M pipeline gap with no clear DRI or action items captured. Your “Weekly Demand Gen” call covers multiple topics but ends with vague next steps. The “AWS Demand Gen” strategy discussion with Colton has great ideas but no RAPID framework defining who Recommends, Agrees, Performs, Inputs, and Decides.

**Your action:** Implement the Meeting Owner framework immediately. For every recurring meeting you run, create a standing agenda template with three sections: (1) **Async Prep** (what must be read/reviewed before), (2) **Sync Discussion** (time-boxed decisions only), (3) **Actions** (DRI + due date for every outcome). Start with your Weekly Demand Gen call. Send the agenda 24 hours in advance with a note: “Please review the attached pipeline data before our call. We’ll spend 15 minutes on decisions, not status updates.” Track all actions in a shared Agreement Tracker—a single Notion page where every commitment from every meeting lives. This will cut your meeting time by 30% within two weeks.

## You’re Managing Up Better Than Managing Down

Your 1:1s with Mark and Yasmin show you challenging assumptions and pushing back appropriately. But with Caleb, you’re reviewing his Q3 commission calculations instead of having set clear performance expectations in Q2. You’re “coaching” him through basic execution (LinkedIn connections, cadence consistency) that should be table stakes. You’ve identified he’s maxed out his compensation with minimal outbound prospecting, yet you’re still analyzing spreadsheets rather than having the hard conversation about 2025 expectations.

**Your action:** Schedule a 30-minute meeting with Caleb titled “2025 Role Clarity.” Use Method 3 decision-making: “Caleb, I want your input on how your role should evolve. Here’s what I’m seeing: you’ve maxed out inbound compensation, but we need more outbound pipeline creation. What do you think your role should focus on in 2025?” Listen to his ideas, then create a written straw man: “Here’s what I’m proposing: 60% outbound prospecting with a $500K stage 1 pipeline target, 40% inbound qualification. Your compensation shifts to reflect this. What feedback do you have?” This forces him to own the conversation and gives you a clear accountability framework. If he can’t execute against it, you have a performance issue, not a coaching opportunity.

## You’re Solving Problems That Should Escalate

The Salesforce data corruption from Segment? The marketing attribution being “totally wonky”? The 2026 model misalignment? These aren’t marketing problems—they’re organizational failures that require executive intervention. Yet you’re building solutions (UTM taxonomies, traffic audits, attribution models) instead of forcing Clean Escalations to Mark and the leadership team.

**Your action:** Write a one-page memo titled “Three Organizational Blockers to $4M Pipeline Target” and send it to Mark before your next 1:1. Structure it like this:

**Blocker 1: No Marketing Operations Owner**

- Current state: Will doing tactical execution + strategy
- Impact: $X in opportunity cost from strategic work not done
- Proposal: Hire Marketing Ops Manager by Jan 1, budget $100K

**Blocker 2: Broken Attribution Infrastructure**

- Current state: Can’t measure ROI on $X annual spend
- Impact: Flying blind on channel effectiveness
- Proposal: 30-day sprint with Scratch/Gleb/Nick to fix, Will as DRI

**Blocker 3: 2026 Model Misalignment**

- Current state: $47M pipeline target with $4M in demand gen activities
- Impact: Unrealistic expectations, team demoralization
- Proposal: Half-day XCOM session to align model with actual GTM strategy

This shifts you from problem-solver to problem-identifier. Your job is to surface the issues and propose solutions, not implement them all yourself.

## Protect Your Zone of Genius

Your Energy Audit is screaming at you. You love building frameworks, connecting strategy to execution, and coaching people through complex problems. You don’t love: loading campaigns into Salesforce, reviewing commission spreadsheets, researching webinar platforms, auditing Google Tag Manager, fixing 404 errors. Yet you’re doing all of it.

**Your action:** Block three full days per week with no meetings—your “maker time” for strategic work. On your calendar, label them “Strategic Planning - Do Not Book.” Use this time for the work only you can do: the 2026 demand gen strategy, the AWS partnership framework, the content experience redesign, the sales enablement program. Everything else gets delegated, eliminated, or made “exquisite” by hiring the right person. In your next XCOM meeting, say this: “I’ve analyzed my time. I’m spending 40 hours/week on execution work that should be owned by a Marketing Ops Manager and 10 hours/week on strategic work that drives our pipeline. We need to flip that ratio or we won’t hit our targets.” Show them your Energy Audit data. Make it impossible for them to say no.

**The bottom line:** You’re a VP trapped in a Director’s workload. The company is getting incredible value from you, but you’re subsidizing organizational gaps with your personal capacity. That ends now. Force the hard conversations, demand the resources you need, and protect your time for the work that actually moves the needle. Otherwise, you’ll burn out before you build the machine that scales.
