I've loved you since the moment I met you. And not, the person you tried to be or the various transformations you've gone through. But, the girl underneath it all. The sweaty palmed, blue eyed, meek girl, who just wanted to prove to herself that she was enough. The girl who catches frogs in the woods. The girl who seems to always break herself when shes having too much fun. The girl who wears herself out after 24 hours of social activity. The patient and loving girl who I moved mountains for. 

I have been spending so much time going back and forth about how I feel. 
The honest truth is I have not operating with grace in the past two years and failing to take my share of the accountability of how our marriage became desolate and cold. I understand why you left; and I am sorry that it has taken 4 months of you not being in the house to sort it out. 

I know that we keep missing eachother, and that I should have said this to you 5 weeks ago, or 3 months ago. But, honestly, I was scared, upset, depressed and numb. All feelings that I know you understand, and can empathize with. It feels as though, I am going through the same process as you just lagging behind. 

But, what I do know is that you and I have grown alot even in these few months. And, before I move on, start dating and trying to find someone else, I cant shake this feeling that this is all wrong. 

I cant in good consciousness not give it one more opportunity. One more good effort to try and come back to you. Not to try and "go back", not even to "restart fully", but just to at least not give up on what was the most important relationship I have ever had. I am also not saying us retrying will work. Just that I am in a place to try for real. 

If the time is passed. If you know in your heart that you can never love me as deeply as you did. Then, I will do what I need to do to move on and start healing.
