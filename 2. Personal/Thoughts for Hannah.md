I've loved you since the moment I met you. And not, the person that has been a version of the various transformations you've gone through. But, the girl underneath it all. The sweaty palmed, blue eyed, meek girl, who just wanted to prove to herself that she was enough. The girl who catches frogs in the woods. The girl who seems to always break herself when she having too much fun. The girl who wears herself out after 24 hours of social activity. The patient and loving girl who I've always wanted to move mountains for. I am not sure what happened to made me hesitant to do that this time. 

In the last four months, I have been spending so much time going back and forth about how I feel. 

The honest truth is I have not operating with grace in the past two years and failing to take my share of the accountability of how our marriage became desolate and cold. There have been so many moments where you did not get the patience, appreciation, attention, or adoration that you deserved. I could be controlling and self-occupied when it counted; none of this was fair to you.  

I understand why you left; something needed to change. We needed a shock to our relationship and I am sorry that it has taken 4 months of you not being in the house to finally understand that. 

I know that we keep missing each other, and that I should have said this to you 5 weeks ago, or 3 months ago. But, honestly, I was scared, upset, depressed and numb. All feelings that I know you understand, and can empathize with. It feels as though, I am going through the same process as you just lagging behind. I cant shake this feeling that this is all wrong. and at some point, if there is any chance of us ever sorting this out... one of us has to be bold, and the other has to take a leap of faith. 

But, what I do know is that you and I have grown a lot even in these few months. And I am working really hard on myself in ways I know I can show you. So, before I move on, start dating and trying to find someone else, I want to see if you have it in your heart to try in some way to come back together.  

I cant in good consciousness not give it one more opportunity. One more good effort to try and come back to you. Not to try and "go back", not even to "restart fully", but just to at least not give up on what was the most important relationship I have ever had. I am also not saying us retrying will work; because we may be past it. What I am saying is that I know we haven't given it a full try, and I think we owe it to each other to try. And, that I am in a place to do just that. 

Whatever happens, things won't ever be the same. Its not fair for you to feel as though you just a person in a movie about my life. And, I want a movie with a co-star, which I know I had in you, but I am sure it often didnt feel that way. 

I guess I have some hope that if we can work it out, we will look back at this time as a moment that made us stronger than ever. A necessary valley in our relationship. 

If that time has passed for you. If you know in your heart that you can never love me as deeply as you did. Then, I will do what I need to do to move on and start healing.
