I've loved you since the moment I met you. And not the person who has been a version of the various transformations you've gone through. But the girl underneath it all. The sweaty-palmed, blue-eyed, meek girl, who just wanted to prove to herself that she was enough. The girl who catches frogs in the woods. The girl who always seems to break herself when she's having too much fun. The girl who wears herself out after 24 hours of social activity. The patient and loving girl whom I've always wanted to move mountains for. I don't know what happened to make me hesitant to do that this time. 

In the last four months, I have been spending so much time going back and forth about how I feel. 

The truth is, I have not been operating with grace in the past two years and have been failing to take my share of the accountability for how our marriage became desolate and cold. There have been so many moments where you did not get the patience, appreciation, attention, or adoration that you deserved. I could be controlling and self-occupied when it counted; none of this was fair to you.  

I understand why you left; something needed to change. We needed a shock to our relationship, and I am sorry that it has taken 4 months of you not being in the house to understand that finally. 

I know that we keep missing each other, and that I should have said this to you 5 weeks ago, or 3 months ago. But, honestly, I was scared, upset, depressed, and numb. All feelings that I know you understand, and can empathize with. It feels as though I am going through the same process as you, just lagging. I cant shake this feeling that this is all wrong. And at some point, if there is any chance of us ever sorting this out... one of us has to be bold, and the other has to take a leap of faith. 

But what I do know is that you and I have grown a lot even in these few months. And I am working really hard on myself in ways I can show you. So, before I move on, start dating and trying to find someone else, I want to see if you have it in your heart to try in some way to come back together.  

I cant in good conscience not give it one more opportunity. One more good effort to try to come back to you. Not to try and "go back", not even to "restart fully", but just to at least not give up on what was the most important relationship I have ever had. I am also not saying that retrying will work, because we may be past it. I know we haven't given it a full try, and I think we owe it to each other to try. And, that I am in a place to do just that. 

Whatever happens, things won't ever be the same. It's not fair for you to feel as though you're just a person in a movie about my life. And, I want a film with a co-star, which I know I had in you, but I am sure it often didn't feel that way. 

I guess I have some hope that if we can work it out, we will look back at this time as a moment that made us stronger than everâ€”a necessary valley in our relationship. 

Suppose that time has passed for you. If you know in your heart that you can never love me as deeply as you did. Then, I will do what I need to do to move on and start healing.
