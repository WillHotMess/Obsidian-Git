## Key Observations:

**Your Parts in Action:**

- **Lonely Boy** is very present - the little one who learned early that adult problems took precedence over his needs
- **"Yes, But"** is working overtime, trying to rationalize and explain away difficult emotions (both yours and Hannah's)
- The session itself shows "Yes, But" activating multiple times when Frank points to painful truths

**Critical Insight About Part Relationships:** You've identified something crucial - how "Yes, But" has been undermining emotional connection in your marriage by dismissing Hannah's feelings with logic. This is exactly the kind of systemic understanding that leads to real change.

**The Parenting Connection:** What's beautiful is how you're connecting your experience as a father to what you needed as a child. You said: _"I didn't have that as a kid and I didn't really know how to give it to myself because I wasn't a parent."_ This realization that you can now parent yourself through this crisis is profound.

**Frank's Challenge:** He's essentially asking you to let "Yes, But" step back enough to feel the full emotional reality of this loss - not to be overwhelmed by it, but to be present with it while your Self provides the loving support you didn't receive as a child.

## Questions for You:

1. **In this moment right now** - how do you feel toward Lonely Boy as you read about him in this transcript? Can you sense him and what he needs from you?
    
2. **"Yes, But" is probably activated** by Frank's suggestions about sitting with difficult emotions. What does that part want you to know about why it works so hard to explain things away?
    
3. **The "both-and" approach** Frank describes - staying in the middle where you feel everything while also managing - how does that land with your system? Which parts feel resistant to that idea?
    

You're in such a profound passage of potential transformation. The disruption, while painful, is creating space for parts that have been running your life to potentially step into healthier roles.
