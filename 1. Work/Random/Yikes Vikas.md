Team,

In accordance with the announcement made on June 10th, today is, unfortunately, the last working day for many of my teammates, colleagues, and friends.

Whoever worked on CSMP ‚Äî whether from the current team, those who moved to other projects, or those who have already left CloudBolt ‚Äî almost everyone joined the company at an early stage in their career (i.e., with 1‚Äì4 years of experience). As a team, we accomplished some amazing things:

We didn't have a fancy tech stack, but we have a stack that is capable of solving real customer use cases and delivering value.We didn't have fancy roles or complex organisational structures, but we have the right attitude, focus, dedication, consistency and hunger to solve customer use cases/problems.We didn‚Äôt spend days or weeks in planning before starting development on any use case. Instead, we consistently focused, executed, and delivered solutions within days or weeks.We didn‚Äôt follow a culture where everyone had to know everything. Instead, we aligned each individual‚Äôs focus on specific areas of responsibility, accountability, and ownership based on their expertise.We didn‚Äôt celebrate or talk much about our success in front of the company. Instead, we believed in letting our work speak for itself ‚Äî and letting customers speak for it.We didn‚Äôt limit ourselves to a strict 8-hour workday. We valued our customers‚Äô time and often worked late evenings, sometimes even late nights and weekends, to keep them happy and maintain their trust and relationship with the company. Most importantly, the team continued this level of commitment(i.e. For CSP work) even after the June 10th announcement ‚Äî and that is the true DNA of the team.
Over the past two years, the CSMP team size decreased from 60 to 10, with several talented experts leaving during this time. We operated in a sustainable mode, focusing solely on customer requests(i.e. And No Real Product Roadmap).

And Still, the CSMP product continues to deliver value to customers today and remains a valid solution for new potential customers and POCs. I believe this is our SUCCESS ‚Äî the SUCCESS of the CSMP team and every individual who contributed to it.

We‚Äôve set a strong example of how a junior team can build a product that truly delivers value and addresses real customer use cases. Believe me, not every team ‚Äî even those with experience ‚Äî can manage to do that.

I am extremely proud of what we, as a team, have built. I am equally proud of each individual‚Äôs contribution to this successful product. Every one of you should be proud of your contributions to this product, especially at such an early stage in your career.

I firmly believe that a company‚Äôs true assets aren‚Äôt its products, but the people who build them. CloudBolt is losing those invaluable assets ‚Äî today, in the coming weeks, and in the months ahead. "The Cloud ROI Company" is losing "The Team(i.e. FinOps, BillOps Expertise) with the Highest ROI".

Thanks, @Dinesh Mudit, for building this amazing team and supporting us throughout the entire journey.

I believe each of you will go on to achieve even greater things in your careers ahead.

Wishing you all continued success, and I hope our paths cross again someday. Let's stay in touch!

All the very best in your future endeavors üçÄ ‚Äî and thank you once again, everyone!!

Thanks!!!
