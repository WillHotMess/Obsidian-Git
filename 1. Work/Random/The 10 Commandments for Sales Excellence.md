### **1. BE THE CUSTOMER CHAMPION**  
Walk in your customer’s shoes. Understand their world deeply—what keeps them up at night, what drives their goals—and advocate for their success as if it were your own.
### **2. LIVE THE TRUTH**  
Trust is our currency. Be authentic, transparent, and realistic in every interaction. Only promise what we can deliver—and then over-deliver on those promises.
### **3. KNOW YOUR STUFF**  
Be the expert your customers rely on. Master our solutions, understand the competitive landscape, and articulate “why us” with confidence and clarity.
### **4. EMBRACE THE DETAILS**  
Details drive deals. Treat Salesforce as your single source of truth—keep records accurate, notes detailed, and opportunity statuses current to ensure seamless collaboration.
### **5. FUEL THE MOMENTUM**  
Every interaction should move the needle. Whether it’s a discovery call or a contract negotiation, drive meaningful progress and avoid letting opportunities stall.
### **6. CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO**  
Be a trusted advisor who questions assumptions respectfully. Help customers see beyond their current state to envision a better future—and show them how we’ll get there together.
### **7. LEAD THE CHARGE**  
Sales isn’t a solo mission—it’s a team sport. Orchestrate internal resources like a conductor leading an orchestra to deliver maximum value to every customer.
### **8. OWN THE NEXT STEP**  
Momentum thrives on clarity. End every conversation with clear, actionable next steps that both you and the customer commit to.
### **9. BUILD THE COALITION**  
Winning deals requires winning hearts and minds. Identify and engage all stakeholders—champions, influencers, and decision-makers—to build consensus and drive alignment.
### **10. DELIVER REAL IMPACT**  
Our success is measured by the value we create for customers. Focus relentlessly on delivering outcomes that solve real problems and make a tangible difference in their business.
