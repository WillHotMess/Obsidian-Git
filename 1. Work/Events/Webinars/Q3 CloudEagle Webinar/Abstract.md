**FinOps Beyond Cloud: Driving Immediate ROI from Unified SaaS & Cloud Cost Management**

## **Abstract:**

As FinOps matures, organizations are realizing that true financial accountability doesn’t end with cloud infrastructure—it must also encompass SaaS. Yet while public cloud billing continues to standardize through initiatives like the FOCUS specification, the world of software licensing remains fragmented, inconsistent, and frustratingly manual.

Join CloudBolt and CloudEagle for an exclusive webinar where we’ll explore how FinOps teams can start delivering real business value _today_—without waiting for industry standards or SaaS vendors to catch up.

In this session, we’ll unpack:
✅ The current state of multi-cloud and SaaS cost visibility, and why FOCUS—while powerful—isn’t enough (yet)  
✅ Why FinOps teams are increasingly expected to manage SaaS licenses—and what that means for tooling, team structure, and ROI  
✅ Practical, actionable strategies to unify your cloud and SaaS financial management using automation, AI, and connected platforms
✅ How FinOps can be a **strategic** **partner** to Procurement, ITAM, and Finance.  Where to lead, where to collaborate, and where to support across the SaaS and cloud lifecycle

Whether you're a FinOps leader, IT procurement strategist, or SaaS owner trying to get ahead of shadow IT and sprawl, this webinar will show you how to operationalize a unified FinOps approach—and start driving measurable savings and value _immediately_.
