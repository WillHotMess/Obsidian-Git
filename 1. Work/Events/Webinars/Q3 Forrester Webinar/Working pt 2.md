# The Cloud+ Confidence Crisis

## 72% of IT Leaders Say Their Teams Are Ready for Cloud+ Scopes. But Are We?

### This Confidence Comes from the Top

**350 senior IT leaders surveyed. 80% VP-level or above.** These aren't isolated voices—they're the executives responsible for translating cloud strategy into business value. The people driving billions in cloud spend.

### The Scope Expansion Confidence

**"How prepared is your team to expand FinOps practices beyond traditional public cloud?"**

|Readiness Level|% of IT Leaders|
|---|---|
|**Mostly or Fully Prepared**|**72%**|
|**At Least Moderately Prepared**|**96%**|

### The Reality Check Question

> _"If IT leaders are this confident about expanding into SaaS, private cloud, and AI optimization... how are their teams actually performing with basic public cloud FinOps?"_

**Let's examine three signals from these same 350 executives that suggest we might not be as ready as we think:**

---

# Signal #1: The Cloud ROI Crisis

## If You Can't Prove Public Cloud Value, How Will You Prove SaaS + AI + Private Cloud?

### The Promise vs. Reality Gap

**What Leaders Want to Show:**

- Revenue growth (43%)
- Operational efficiency (36%)
- Cost savings vs. on-prem (35%)
- Security & compliance benefits (35%)

**What's Actually Blocking Them:**

- **55%** - Difficulty linking cloud spend to business outcomes
- **48%** - Organizational misalignment and silos
- **44%** - Inefficient resource management (poor tagging)

### The Disconnect

> _"Teams are aiming for the finish line—revenue, agility, scale—but skipping the telemetry, hygiene, and governance needed to prove any of it."_

### Visual Suggestion

- Split screen showing "Executive Expectations" vs "Operational Reality"
- Bar chart showing the 78% statistic prominently
- Icons representing the top 3 blockers

# Signal #2: The Automation Illusion

## Ready to Automate Across More Scopes? You're Not Even Automating Current Scope Effectively

### The Shocking Reality of FinOps Priorities

**What consistently receives priority across organizations? (Select all that apply)**

|Optimization Activity|% Organizations|
|---|---|
|**Automated shutdown schedules**|**41%**|
|**Identifying idle resources**|**36%**|
|AI/ML assisted optimization|**33%**|
|Commitment discount management|**31%**|
|**Container/K8s optimization**|**28%**|
|**Rightsizing underutilized resources**|**24%**|

### The Brutal Truth

- **76%** of organizations DON'T consistently prioritize rightsizing
- **72%** DON'T consistently prioritize Kubernetes optimization
- **69%** DON'T consistently prioritize commitment management
- **But 92%** claim they have "automated" FinOps**

### The Real Automation Illusion

> _"Organizations are claiming automation maturity while 3 out of 4 don't even consistently work on rightsizing—one of the highest-impact optimizations available. You can't automate what you're not even doing."_

### Meanwhile, the Execution Gap Widens

|Claimed vs. Reality|Percentage|
|---|---|
|**65%**|Say 20%+ of optimization recommendations go unimplemented|
|**58%**|Take weeks or longer to remediate cloud waste|
|**17%**|Actually have fully automated environments|

### The Problem Behind the Problem

> _"This isn't an automation problem—it's a priority problem. Teams are focused on easy wins (shutdown scripts) while ignoring the fundamentals that drive real ROI. How can you claim mature FinOps when you're not even consistently doing the basics?"_

### Visual Suggestion

- Speedometer/dial graphic showing the gap between perceived vs actual automation
- Timeline showing weeks of lag time for remediation
	- "Automation Maturity Pyramid" showing where teams think they are vs where they actually are

# Signal #3: Current Scope Blindspots (Kubernetes)

## We Already Have a "Cloud+" Scope Problem - And We're Failing At It

### The Kubernetes Reality Check: 98% Impact, 91% Can't Optimize

**Universal Impact:** 98% agree Kubernetes significantly drives cloud spend

**Universal Struggle:** 91% say they can't actually optimize Kubernetes costs

### Where Teams Are Failing

| Challenge                                           | % of Organizations |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Unable to perform cost optimization on K8s clusters | **49%**            |
| Struggling with horizontal autoscaling              | **45%**            |
| Can't allocate costs at workload level              | **44%**            |
| Struggling with vertical autoscaling                | **43%**            |
| Unable to generate cost reporting                   | **33%**            |

### Why Kubernetes Is Different

- **Complexity outpacing capability**
- Cost buried in layers of abstraction
- Shared nodes, ephemeral workloads
- Disconnected tagging, autoscaling behaviors
- Container adoption: 24% CAGR growth

### The Growing Blind Spot

> _"Even teams with mature cost governance elsewhere find themselves flying blind in Kubernetes. With container adoption showing no signs of slowing—especially in AI/ML workflows—this blind spot is only getting more expensive."_

### Visual Suggestion

- Kubernetes "black box" visual with cost data going in but no visibility coming out
- Heat map showing K8s spend distribution
- Iceberg diagram showing visible vs hidden K8s costs
- Growth chart showing container adoption vs optimization capability

## How This Reframes the Entire Webinar

**Opening Hook:** "72% of IT leaders say their teams are ready for Cloud+ scopes. But are we?"

**Credibility Anchor:** "This confidence comes from 350 senior IT executives—80% VP-level or above"

**Tracy's Macro Context:** Sets up the scope expansion imperative and market forces driving IT leaders

**Kyle's Reality Check:** Three concrete signals from these same executives that suggest current scope mastery is lacking

**The Payoff:** IT leaders need their teams to master connected action in their current scope before expanding - making this both a cautionary tale and a roadmap for getting ready for the inevitable scope expansion.

**Visual Flow Suggestion:**

- Start with the leadership confidence statistics (72% of IT leaders ready)
- Establish credibility with the survey demographics
- Build tension with "But let's check three signals from these same executives..."
- Each signal reinforces the gap between executive confidence and operational capability
- End with the scope expansion reality check and path forward for IT leaders

## Action Stack Recommendations (For Each Signal)

### Signal #1 Action Stack: Master ROI Before Expanding Scope

✅ **Bake tagging into provisioning**—prerequisite for any scope expansion  
✅ **Shift to business impact metrics**—cost-per-feature, per-team allocation  
✅ **Align FinOps goals with product/engineering KPIs**—foundation for SaaS/AI scope success

### Signal #2 Action Stack: Fix Fundamentals Before Adding Complexity

✅ **Define "done" by what gets remediated**—not what gets flagged across any scope  
✅ **Empower engineering teams** to act on recommendations autonomously  
✅ **Move toward real-time loops**—essential for managing multiple scopes

### Signal #3 Action Stack: Prove You Can Handle Current "Cloud+" Before Expanding

✅ **Get pod-level visibility**—demonstrate you can manage container complexity  
✅ **Converge FinOps + Platform Engineering** responsibilities—model for future scope convergence  
✅ **Leverage ML-based rightsizing** tuned to app behavior—foundation for AI scope optimization

## Connecting Thread: Are IT Leaders Ready for Cloud+ Scopes?

### The Evidence from 350 Executives Says No - And Here's Why

**The Pattern Across All Three Signals:**

- **Signal 1**: IT leaders can't prove ROI on current public cloud scope (78%)
- **Signal 2**: Their teams aren't consistently doing high-impact work (76% skip rightsizing)
- **Signal 3**: They can't optimize existing container workloads (98% impact, 91% can't optimize)

**The Scope Expansion Reality:**

> _"72% of IT leaders say their teams are ready for SaaS, private cloud, and AI scopes. But if you can't prove ROI, consistently optimize, or handle Kubernetes in your current scope... how will you handle 3x the complexity?"_

**The Shift That's Needed:**

> _"Before expanding scopes, IT leaders need their teams to master connected action in their current scope. Move from reactive mode to continuous optimization. That's what will separate leaders who successfully handle Cloud+ from those who multiply their dysfunction across more domains."_

# Prompt: 
```
# I think we will begin the webinar with the big statement:
Slide 1: 
- "We are going to begin today's webinar with a bold statistic:
    -- 72% of IT leaders say their teams are ready for SaaS, private cloud, and AI scopes.

# Then, introduce, CloudBolt Industry insights: 
Slide 2: 
- CloudBolt Industry Insights is the research arm of CloudBolt Software. CII regularly develops reports on the state of the cloud industry to determine the reality of the challenges IT leaders are facing and how they plan to overcome them.
- Who took the survey:
senior voices, strategic stakes
This year’s CII report speaks from the top.
Focused geographically on the United States, more than 80% of respondents were VP-level or above, with strong
representation from CIOs and CTOs—the executives responsible for translating cloud strategy into business value.
Additional insights:
• Nearly 90% hold a bachelor’s degree or higher
• 59% work at enterprises with 6,000+ employees
• Most responses came from the South (35%) and West (29%), with California (11%) leading by state
These aren’t isolated voices—they’re the people driving billions in cloud spend. And their responses reveal where
gaps in execution, alignment, and maturity still persist—even at the highest levels.

	# Our survey found a large gap between perception and actual performance from senior leaders. We will be asking three primary questions today? 
	1. Are we effectively managing our current scope of resources? 
	2. Are we effectively keeping costs under control in the public cloud? 
	3. Are we effectively proving value? 


# Then, we will use this slide design for an agenda - talking to the audience in a candid, frank, way,
Slide 4: 
"During today's webinar, our goal is the following:

1. Get a pulse from Tracy Woo, who is a foremost expert on the changing nature of the FinOps market and trends in 2025.
    
2. Examine the 3 signals, from our own research that suggest, FinOps teams may need to examine their readiness for expanded scopes.
    
3. Discuss the best ways to get a grip on the current state

None of this is to suggest that FinOps leaders should shy away from expanded their perview, moreso, ensure that they are not scaling without taming scope debt that will bite them in the future.
