### **ACTION NEEDED:**
1. Start reaching out to prospects and customers ASAP to gauge their attendance plans
2. Begin scheduling meetings for these events (especially FinOps X)
3. Consider which prospects/customers would benefit from attending our speaking sessions
4. Share any intelligence about who's attending so we can coordinate our approach

Let me know if you need any collateral or talking points to help with your outreach efforts.

Looking forward to maximizing our ROI from these events!
