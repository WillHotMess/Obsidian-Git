### **From Autonomous Rightsizing to Bill-Accurate Cost Allocation**

- **Reconcile to Your Actual Bill:** We use your real costs, including enterprise discounts and credits, not generic list prices.
- **Achieve Container-Level Granularity:** Trace every dollar of spend directly to the individual container.
- **Intelligently Distribute Shared Costs:** Fairly allocate idle capacity, control plane, and system overhead with configurable logic.
- **Enable True Chargeback:** Flow precise cost data into CloudBolt’s robust chargeback and invoicing system.
