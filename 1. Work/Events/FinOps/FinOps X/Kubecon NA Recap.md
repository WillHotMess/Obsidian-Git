# White Oak
## Attendees
- Perfect venue, close proximity to the convention center, food was great, drink experience was a hit, size and intimacy/setup were all spot on.
	- Seated dinner would not have worked. 
	- CloudBolt 
- We registered over 44 people from major corporations including Duke Energy, OutSystems, Visa, Nationwide, SUSE, and 3DS (Dassault Systèmes), along with consulting firms like Slalom, financial services companies, and a few academic institutions including Georgia Tech and Johns Hopkins.

# Booth & Conference
- We heard that there was a big drop off in total KC registrants who attended - This was likely due to two things:
	- Government shutdown /  flight reductions
	- EMEA Amsterdam event coming quick (many EU community members were not sent)
- Too many employees in attendance
	- Moving forward a largely technical sales team is needed.
	- It is evident that we need people that can speak to K8s, language/terminology was most important. 
- Swag could have been more creative.
	- Too many shirts
	- Books were a hit (rinse and repeat in Amsterdam)
	- We had leftover stickers and pens from prior events, which was nice to use.
