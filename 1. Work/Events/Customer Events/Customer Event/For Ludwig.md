**Subject:** Converge 2025 – Theme Recap & Presentation Framework

Hi Ludwig,

Thanks again for making time to connect. Really enjoyed the conversation—and I’m looking forward to having you at Converge. Your story is a strong fit for this year’s theme, and I think it’ll resonate across the room.

Let me give you a quick rundown of the key ideas, a suggested framework for your talk, and a lightweight template you can use to prep content. No pressure to make this overly polished—bullet points are great. I’ll help shape it into something presentable.

**Conference Theme: “Convergence in the Cloud”**

This year’s narrative centers on how cloud, finance, and operations teams are increasingly interdependent. The old silos are breaking down—either because orgs are maturing into more integrated models, or because modern companies (like yours) never had them to begin with.

We’re highlighting use cases where **Build**, **Manage**, and **Optimize** aren’t distinct phases, but part of a shared lifecycle. That’s where your story fits perfectly: you’re solving for deployment velocity, but doing it in a way that improves operational readiness and financial accountability downstream.

**Suggested Presentation Structure (Target: 20 minutes)**

Here’s a proposed flow that aligns with how the other sessions are being structured:

| Section                             | Focus                                                                                              | Your Input                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Who is Lobster?**              | Quick intro to the business—your model, your role, and what makes you different                    | [e.g. Who you serve, how you're structured]            |
| **2. What Was the Challenge?**      | Prior environment: manual provisioning, resource sprawl, reliance on a small team                  | [e.g. Manual process, time required, operational pain] |
| **3. What Changed with CloudBolt?** | How you implemented it: blueprints, automation, provisioning time drop (6hrs → 25min)              | [e.g. Blueprints, lifecycle hooks, provisioning flow]  |
| **4. Impact**                       | Key results: speed, consistency, security, cost controls (e.g. RDS automation, academy scheduling) | [e.g. Time savings, consistency, operational impact]   |
| **5. What’s Next?**                 | Early thinking on platform engineering / IDP vision                                                | [e.g. Platform engineering, future use cases]          |
| **6. Optional Visual**              | Quick demo or screenshot if you’re comfortable—just to ground the story                            | [Demo flow]                                            |
| **7. Wrap & Q&A**                   | 2–3 minutes buffer for questions                                                                   |                                                        |


Let me know if this is missing anything. I’ll take whatever you send and start shaping it into slides. We can reconnect in mid-August to review and make adjustments together.

Also—per your ask—I’ll send a separate note with logistics and travel info for your team. Expect that shortly.

Appreciate you jumping in on this. I think your session’s going to stand out.

Best,  
William
