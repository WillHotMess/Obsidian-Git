## Key Concerns & Your Strategy to Address Them

- **The Problem:** **Lack of Ownership.** Your CSO, Yasmin, feels that no one is driving the content end-to-end. Tasks are being assigned, but there's no central driver ensuring completion, leading to confusion and a feeling that "no one's doing anything."
    
- **Your Solution:** On the call, position yourself as the **single point of ownership for the content narrative**. You are not just coordinating; you are building the core presentations. Their role is to be the subject matter expert who provides the key points and sharpens the message you've drafted.
    
- **The Problem:** **Communication Breakdown.** Your conversations with Yasmin and the Slack threads show that your plans aren't visible to leadership. The meeting on Thursday with the sales team went "off the rails" because the right messenger (you) wasn't there to provide a confident update.
    
- **Your Solution:** Use this meeting to **over-communicate the plan**. Walk them through the agenda you've already framed. The confidence you showed Yasmin in your 1:1 needs to be projected to this entire group.
    
- **The Problem:** **Speaker Time & Effort.** Key speakers like Kyle are over-committed. There's an expectation that speakers will build their own presentations from scratch, which isn't feasible.
    
- **Your Solution:** Reassure them that you will do the **heavy lifting**. Explicitly state that you and your team will create the PowerPoint decks based on their input. Their "homework" will be limited to providing bullet points or participating in a short work session, not spending 10 hours building slides.

## Talking Points & Agenda for Your Speaker Call

Here is a proposed flow for your meeting to establish control and clarity.

### 1. Reiterate the Vision & Goal (The "Why")
"Thanks for joining. The goal of this meeting is to align on our content strategy for Converge. As you know, the theme is about breaking down silos between cloud automation, orchestration, and FinOps. Our goal is to tell one cohesive story across three acts: **Build**, **Manage**, and **Optimize**. My role is to ensure all the content connects to this central theme."

### 2. Define the Process & Roles (The "How")
"To make this easy on everyone, I want to be clear about the process. I will be taking the lead on creating the slide decks for each session. I don't expect you to build presentations from scratch. I need your expertise to shape the story and ensure it's authentic. I'll do the heavy lifting on content creation; you'll work with me to refine it and make it your own."

### 3. Review Track-Specific Plans (The "What")
Go through each track and provide a prescriptive plan based on your notes and Shawn's input.
- **For the Build Track (Mike & Augie):**
    - "Shawn has confirmed that **Lobster** is our best customer story for the Build track. They use a CMP Blueprint to deploy a custom SaaS product in AWS. This is a powerful story. I'll connect with them to draft a talk track, but Mike and Augie, I need your help outlining the core product content that frames this customer success."
- **For the Manage Track (Rick & Yasmin):**
    - "For this track, we'll feature **Cigna**. They use CMP for day-to-day management and are on a FinOps journey with VMware. This directly supports our 'Converge' theme. Rick and Yasmin, your session will set the stage for how our platform manages complex environments before Cigna tells their story."
- **For the Optimize Track (Kyle & Yasmin):**
    - "This track will focus on StormForge and our advanced optimization capabilities. Kyle, I know you're on PTO, so the initial lift here will be light. Yasmin, let's you and I frame the high-level narrative. We'll then have a focused session with Kyle when he's back to inject his vision and technical depth. We can potentially slot in a customer like **US Bank** or **Aquia** here."

### 4. Action Items & Next Steps

End the call with clear, simple, and immediate next steps.
- **My Action Item:** "I will draft the initial talk tracks for Lobster and Cigna and set up interviews with them."
- **Your Action Item:** "By the end of this week, I need each track owner to send me **3-5 bullet points** outlining the core message of their section. Don't worry about slides, just the key ideas you want to communicate. We'll use those to build the first draft of the presentations."
- **Next Meeting:** "I'll put another check-in on the calendar for next week to review progress."
Here is a summary of the meeting for your team's Slack channel.

**Quick Recap: Converge Content Planning Call**

Thanks for making time today, everyone. For those who couldn't join, here’s a quick summary of our discussion and next steps.

Our primary focus is to tell one cohesive story across the **Build, Manage, and Optimize** tracks. The goal is to break down silos and show how our solutions work together, ensuring the entire event is engaging for all attendees.

### Action Items & Next Steps

- **For Speakers:** Please review the draft outlines pinned in this channel. The goal is not for you to build full presentations. Instead, please provide a rough draft of your key talking points and ideas.
    Once I have your rough outlines, I will do the heavy lifting of building out the initial PowerPoint decks for us to review and refine together.
    
- **Timeline:** Let's aim to have the outlines in a good place over the next ~3 weeks. I’ll start creating the PowerPoint decks in the third week of August.
    

Great discussion today! I hope everyone is feeling good about our path forward.
