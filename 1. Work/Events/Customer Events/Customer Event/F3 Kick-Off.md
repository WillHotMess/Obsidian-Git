This year's theme centers on how cloud, finance, and operations teams are increasingly interdependent. The old silos are breaking down—either because organizations are maturing into more integrated models, or because modern companies never had them to begin with.

We're highlighting use cases where **Build**, **Manage**, and **Optimize** aren't distinct phases, but part of a shared lifecycle—and as a partner who's helped multiple organizations navigate this transformation, your perspective would be invaluable.

From there, I'll take the lead on building the core content in PowerPoint—no heavy lifting required on your end. We'll get drafts back to you for review well ahead of the event, so you'll have plenty of time to make adjustments and get comfortable with the material.

What I'd love to understand in our initial conversation:

**Your Partner Perspective**
- How F3 approaches cloud management challenges across your customer base
- What you're seeing in the market that's driving organizations toward integrated cloud strategies

**Customer Transformation Stories**
- Examples of organizations you've helped transition (like the Cigna journey)
- Common "before state" challenges your customers face
- Typical implementation approach and timeline

**Measurable Outcomes**
- Key metrics and improvements you're seeing across customer implementations
- How CloudBolt CMP fits into your broader technology recommendations
- Success patterns that are repeatable across different industries/company sizes

**Market Insights**
- Where you see cloud management heading
- How partner-led implementations differ from direct vendor relationships
- Your recommendations for organizations considering similar transformations
