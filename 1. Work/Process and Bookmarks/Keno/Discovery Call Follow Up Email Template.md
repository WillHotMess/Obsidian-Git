Confirmed. Yes, I want Caleb to route all leads to me going forward as soon as I roll out the new named accounts protocol (on my list to get to this week).

- Trimmed Audience - 
 
Keno, Nick, and Caleb,
 
I want to make sure we're all aligned on the process changes moving forward, especially around Caleb's discovery workflow and handoff to the AE team.
 
Current State: Caleb is doing 15-20 min upfront discovery for light qualification, then booking a hybrid sales discovery/product demo call with both AE and SE per Geo alignment.
 
New Process (My Understanding):
1.	Marketing Discovery - Caleb continues his current discovery process to qualify MQLs for Sales
2.	AE Discovery Only - Hand off to AE for a separate 30-minute discovery call (no SE, no demo yet)
3.	Demo - Comes after AE discovery confirms opportunity meets criteria
 
Keno, can you confirm? 
 
Also, do you want Caleb to route all qualified opportunities through you first for "NFL draft style" mapping to the right AE, or should he continue following current geo territories?
 
Will

Thanks Nick, team please cc me, Nick and all relevant ExComm individuals who participate in the intro calls going forward.  It's important to demonstrate we listened intently during discovery and can effectively articulate how CB addresses the business requirements so we can "lead the witness" and deposition the competition in one fell swoop.
