Team,

I want to start a practice where we celebrate each other's wins company wide and also help each other understand what led to the win so we can leverage best practices across all teams. I call this a BOOM message and I will be sending these out every time we close a deal north of $50K for either a new deal or an upsell. So when I ask you to send me the BOOM the script will be as follows:

1. Preamble by me (I'll produce)
2. Overview of the Account
3. What they bought and deal size
4. Who we competed against and why the selected us
5. Acknowledgment of key team members contributions and thanks
6. Future plans to grow the business

I want to develop carpel tunnel syndrome because I'm sending these out so often!! Put me to work!!! Good BOOMING and Good Selling!!
