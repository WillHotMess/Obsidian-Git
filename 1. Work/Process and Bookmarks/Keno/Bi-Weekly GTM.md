## Key Operating Principles for This Meeting:

1. **Data First, Opinions Second**: Every assertion backed by numbers
2. **No Vanity Metrics**: Only metrics that drive decisions
3. **Binary Accountability**: Actions are either done or not done
4. **30-Day Rule**: Any initiative without progress in 30 days gets killed or escalated
5. **Quality > Quantity**: Better to review 5 meaningful items than 20 superficial ones

## Pre-Meeting Requirements:

- Will: Update marketing funnel metrics and channel ROI 24 hours prior
- Nick: Pipeline coverage and progression analysis ready
- Both: Flag any deals for "stuck pipeline" discussion
- Both: Prepare 1-2 strategic topics for deep dive

## Success Metrics for This Meeting Series:

- Stage 4+ pipeline coverage improves to 4x within 90 days
- VP+ meeting percentage reaches 35% within 60 days
- Marketing sourced pipeline mix reduces from current high % to healthier 50%
- Sales sourced pipeline increases from ~0% to 25%
- Zero deals sitting idle >30 days without action

**Note**: Based on Keno's style, keep presentations tight, use actual numbers not percentages where possible, and always have a "so what" and recommended action for each data point presented.
