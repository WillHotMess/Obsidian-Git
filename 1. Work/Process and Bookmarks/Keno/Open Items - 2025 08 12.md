Team,

Apologies for going long on the FC call. There are a handful of open items we didn't get to cover:

1. Please make sure you have completed reading  Power Base Selling by next Monday.
2. Please promote the GigaComm report and repost to your networks on LinkedIn
3. Next week I'll need "Blood Numbers" from each of you for Q3 so please shore up the qualification details for all your deals in play by then and be prepared to commit your book of business for the quarter. Also, start thinking about the paperwork process. There will be distractions between Labor Day and back to school which has the potential to slow things down. 
4. Please scrub your overall forecast and Q4 in particular. Get the trash out of there and close out all stale deals as closed lost. 
5. Please shore up your travel for our upcoming QBR in Atlanta (reminder that hotels will be taken care of)
6. Be on the lookout for a forthcoming email template for intro meeting follow ups that will be required going forward. **Either Will or Nick will be sending that out by tomorrow along with instructions how to leverage Gong to get 70% of it automated so you don't have to create from scratch every time.**
7. Heads up that we should have our new and improved ROI tool for all 4 product lines ready to roll out by the end of the week. Once they are presented and training is complete,  the expectation is that no more quotes will go out the door without an accompanying ROI, even for budgetary quotes going forward. 

Lastly, if anyone has a good Corp Overview PPT I'd appreciate it if you could email it to me. Good progress today but still lots of details to shore up. Have a great week! Good Selling!!

Best,
