**Eyebrow:** Kubernetes Cost Allocation

# Bill-Accurate Kubernetes Costs, Finally

Trace your cloud bills directly to containers, pods, namespaces, and labels—with the only allocation solution that combines universal Kubernetes support, FOCUS compliance, and ML-powered optimization insights.

[Request Private Preview Access] [Watch Demo]

## The Kubernetes cost visibility gap is real

**44%** of organizations cannot allocate Kubernetes costs at the workload level

**28%** report Kubernetes consuming 25-50% of their total cloud spend

**91%** of leaders say container complexity outpaces their finance team's ability to manage costs

Your Kubernetes estate is growing—but it still shows up as an opaque line item on your cloud bill. Finance can't allocate costs to business units. Engineering can't identify waste. And nobody can incentivize efficient resource usage.

---

## Purpose-built for accurate Kubernetes cost attribution

**Eyebrow:** CONTAINER-LEVEL PRECISION

### Real Metrics, Not Approximations

Other tools estimate costs using API queries and assumptions. We deploy an agent that captures actual in-cluster utilization every 15 seconds—the same agent powering our ML optimization—so your allocation reflects what's really happening, not what the control plane thinks is happening.

---

**Eyebrow:** IDLE & OVERHEAD ALLOCATION

### Account for Every Dollar—Including the Waste

Kubernetes clusters have significant costs that can't be directly attributed: idle capacity, kube-system overhead, monitoring agents, networking components. We intelligently distribute these shared costs based on proportional usage or your custom rules—so nothing falls through the cracks.

[See it in action →]

---

**Eyebrow:** UNIVERSAL KUBERNETES SUPPORT

### Any Distribution. Unified Methodology.

EKS, AKS, GKE, OpenShift, Rancher, Tanzu, self-managed—we don't care where you run Kubernetes. Our agent works identically across all distributions, providing consistent FOCUS-compliant allocation regardless of how or where your clusters are deployed.

**Eyebrow:** INTEGRATED OPTIMIZATION

### Connect Costs to Savings Opportunities

We're the only solution where cost allocation and ML-powered optimization share the same data pipeline. See not just what you're spending, but exactly how much each rightsizing recommendation will save—based on your actual negotiated rates, not list prices.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is this different from what Kubecost provides?**  
A: Kubecost provides directional cost estimates based on list prices. CloudBolt traces actual cloud bills—including your negotiated rates, committed use discounts, and credits—down to the container level. We also provide FOCUS-compliant output for integration with broader FinOps workflows and connect cost data directly to ML-powered optimization recommendations.

**Q: Does this work with our existing Kubernetes setup?**  
A: Yes. Our agent deploys via Helm and works across any Kubernetes distribution—EKS, AKS, GKE, OpenShift, Rancher, Tanzu, or self-managed clusters. If you're already using StormForge for optimization, it's the same agent.

**Q: How do you handle shared costs like monitoring and networking?**  
A: Idle capacity and overhead costs (kube-system, monitoring agents, networking) can be distributed proportionally based on actual resource consumption, or you can define custom allocation rules that match your business logic.

**Q: What's the difference between this and native cloud provider Kubernetes cost tools?**  
A: Native tools only work within their own ecosystem and typically provide namespace-level granularity at best. CloudBolt provides container-level allocation across all clouds with a unified methodology—plus support for on-premises and self-managed clusters that native tools can't touch.

**Q: How long does it take to see results?**  
A: Most organizations see full cost visibility within one hour of agent deployment. The ML optimization recommendations require a 7-day learning period to build accurate models of your workload patterns.

So I agree that it's not a "must-have" tool for us, but there are specific areas where it does add value.

**Where it helps us:**

- **ABM/Account Intent**: Directionally useful when accounts engage with our website. We can see what they're researching and which pages they're viewing, which is valuable for account-based plays.
- **Contact acquisition** (their Sales Intelligence module): Works as our ZoomInfo alternative for building out buying committees.

**Where we struggle:**
- **Multiple GTM plays**: The platform is really designed for single-product companies. We've had to bootstrap our StormForge/FinOps/Billops plays through keyword groups, but the ICP modeling gets muddy when you're running unrelated sales motions through one instance. They'd happily sell us multiple models, but that's not realistic budget-wise.
- **Field adoption**: The intel is largely only valuable if our sales team actually uses it for account research. Right now, we're not seeing strong adoption, which limits the ROI significantly.
- **Low search volume topics**: For niche areas like "Kubernetes rightsizing" or "BillOps," there simply isn't enough keyword research volume for the tool to provide meaningful intent signals.
- **False positives at scale**: Large enterprises (IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, big MSPs) show constant activity because they have thousands of employees searching related terms. The platform flags them as high intent, but it's often just noise - not actual buying signals from decision-makers.

## Updates Needed for Prompt
### Allocation and Chargeback Page
Updated Feature List (add these bullets):
the downfall of the other tools is they dont have the real costs that include the discounts etc, can you add that as a featured bullet (for ex. cast uses on demand rates)

### Kubernetes Rightsizing Hero Page
(not sure i agree with this statement) **Description:** Optimization means nothing without accurate cost data.
