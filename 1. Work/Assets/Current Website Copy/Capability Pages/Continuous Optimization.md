### Headline:

Continuous Cloud Optimization That Runs Itself

### Subheader:

Tired of static reports and backlog pileups? Codify manual reviews into automated policies that execute continuously—finally connecting FinOps goals with engineering workflows.

### Value Propositions:

**Policy-Driven Automation**  
Transform manual reviews into automated workflows with customizable policies that reflect your company's cost priorities.  
**AI-Powered Kubernetes Optimization**  
StormForge-powered machine learning that understands real workload behavior—not just utilization.  
**ROI Tracking**  
Track both projected and realized savings with full attribution, so every optimization delivers measurable business value.  
**Private Cloud Waste Elimination**  
Identify and act on waste in VMware and OpenStack with prebuilt signals and automation.  
**Engineering-FinOps Collaboration**  
Bridge the gap between insights and action with workflows that balance financial targets and engineering realities.  
  

### Primary Features:

- **Cloud Native Actions Framework:** Codify manual processes into automated policies
    
- **Kubernetes ML Optimization:** StormForge-powered workload rightsizing and HPA tuning
    
- **Private Cloud Optimization:** Waste signal configuration for VMware/OpenStack resources
    
- **Idle Resource Automation:** Tag, power off, or delete identified waste automatically
    
- **Customizable Policies:** Define your own rules aligned with company priorities
    
- **Archera Integration:** 30-day Guaranteed RIs with flexibility to terminate anytime

“CloudBolt is transforming the way we manage our cloud resources by simplifying our automation and orchestration tasks, while their FinOps integration is giving us better control over costs.” - Cory Moore, BeyondTrust Orchestration & FinOps

“The forecasting tools helped us predict usage spikes and right-size our commitments—it’s saved us hundreds of thousands by avoiding over-provisioning.” - Direct customer feedback, anonymized for confidentiality

# Frequently asked questions

**Q: How does CloudBolt’s continuous optimization work differently from traditional cost reports?**  
A: Instead of waiting for monthly or quarterly reviews, CloudBolt executes optimization policies automatically. This eliminates idle resources, rightsizes workloads, and enforces cost priorities in near real time.

**Q: Can it optimize Kubernetes clusters we’ve already automated with tools like Karpenter?**  
A: Yes. StormForge-powered optimization complements existing autoscalers by sizing workloads before they’re provisioned, ensuring resources are right-sized at the outset—not just scaled reactively.

**Q: How do we track the ROI of continuous optimization?**  
A: CloudBolt measures both projected and realized savings with full attribution. You’ll see exactly how each optimization—whether in Kubernetes, public cloud, or private cloud—impacts your bottom line.

**Q: Does it work for private cloud environments like VMware or OpenStack?**  
A: Absolutely. CloudBolt applies the same waste detection and automated remediation to VMware and OpenStack, helping you maximize utilization across hybrid and on-premises environments.
