AI-DRIVEN INSIGHTS

### Spot anomalies before they wreck your budget

Your cloud spend doesn't follow a script. Our AI continuously learns your environment, flags unusual spikes in real time, and can trigger automated responses before the cost hits your books. Forecast with confidence using machine learning models tuned to your unique patterns.

COST ALLOCATION

### End the tagging struggle—accurate allocation, fast

No more chasing down bad tags or duct-taping data together. Our FOCUS-native platform automatically maps costs across public cloud, VMware, and Kubernetes—even unallocated capacity—so you get defensible, near-perfect allocation in weeks, not quarters.

CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION

### Take cost savings off the backlog

Recommendations are easy. Action is hard. CloudBolt closes the loop with 24/7 policy-driven automation that rightsizes, reclaims, and removes waste without manual approval chains.

PERFORMANCE METRICS

### Measure what moves the needle

Track KPIs that actually matter to the business. Our FinOps Performance Index™ scores your maturity, cost governance, and speed from insight to action—so you can prove ROI without pulling custom reports.

KUBERNETES VISIBILITY

### Finally see where your Kubernetes dollars go

Kubernetes is your fastest-growing cloud expense—and your biggest blind spot. Our FOCUS-native allocation engine traces costs from cloud bills down to individual containers, including the idle capacity and shared overhead that other tools ignore. Get defensible chargeback numbers without months of tagging cleanup.

#### Why Most FinOps Teams Are Still Stuck—And How to Break the Loop

The 2025 CloudBolt Industry Insights (CII) report revealed that 58% of organizations take weeks or longer to remediate cloud-cost waste—even when the signal is clear. That's the real tension: teams may have visibility, but the follow-through still lags. Dashboards are improving, but the loop between insight and action remains painfully slow. And the speed of \[…\]
