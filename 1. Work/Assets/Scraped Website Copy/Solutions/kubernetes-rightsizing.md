ELIMINATE MANUAL TOIL

### No more manual tuning for CPU and memory requests

Your developers shouldn't have to guess, and your platform team shouldn't burn cycles tweaking YAML. Our ML-powered engine analyzes usage patterns every 15 seconds to forecast demand and rightsize resources automatically—adjusting in real-time to daily usage spikes and long-term trends.

PERFORMANCE WITHOUT COMPROMISE

### Rightsizing that works with your autoscalers

Unlike basic tools that break HPA, our bi-dimensional scaling harmonizes vertical and horizontal pod adjustments. We fine-tune both resource requests and HPA utilization targets—cutting overprovisioning while avoiding CPU throttling, latency issues, or OOMKills.

JVM WORKLOADS

### The only rightsizer that understands Java

Standard rightsizing tools miss the mark with Java. We go deeper—optimizing JVM heap sizes and container memory limits in tandem, so your memory footprint shrinks without triggering GC storms or container crashes.

ENTERPRISE SCALE

### Built to optimize thousands of workloads, automatically

Deployed across some of the largest Kubernetes estates in the world. We auto-discover every pod, learn its patterns in days, and apply optimization recommendations within policy-defined guardrails. Integrates directly into your GitOps pipelines—no rewrites required.

COST VISIBILITY

### Know what you're saving—in real dollars

Your optimization recommendations deserve accurate cost data behind them. Our integrated cost allocation connects directly to your cloud bills, showing actual savings based on your negotiated rates and discounts—not inflated estimates using on-demand pricing. See exactly what each recommendation will save before you apply it, and track realized value after.

### FAQs

- Is StormForge delivered as a SaaS solution or available for on-premises deployment?

StormForge Optimize Live uses a hybrid architecture. The StormForge Agent runs entirely within your Kubernetes cluster (on-premises), collecting metrics and applying recommendations locally. The web application and machine learning control plane are SaaS-hosted, accessible at [app.stormforge.io](http://app.stormforge.io/). This gives you the security of keeping your workload data within your environment while providing the convenience of a managed service for analysis and recommendations.

- How is StormForge hosted within Kubernetes environments?

The StormForge Agent is deployed as a Helm chart directly into your Kubernetes cluster in the _stormforge-system_ namespace. It runs alongside your applications, collecting metrics every 15 seconds and applying recommendations locally. The SaaS control plane processes the machine learning analysis and provides the web interface for viewing recommendations and configuring optimization settings. No application data leaves your cluster – only anonymized usage metrics are transmitted.

- How can recommendations from StormForge be applied?

You have complete flexibility in how you apply recommendations. During the initial 7-day learning period, you can only apply recommendations manually for review. After that, you can: 1) Apply recommendations on-demand through the web UI with "Apply Now", 2) Enable automatic deployment by setting the _live.stormforge.io/auto-deploy_ annotation to "Enabled" for hands-free optimization, or 3) Integrate recommendations into your CI/CD workflow by downloading patches from the UI or using the StormForge CLI. You can also configure deployment thresholds to ensure only impactful changes trigger pod restarts.

- What is the difference between autoscaling and rightsizing, and how does StormForge support both?

Yes, StormForge provides bi-dimensional autoscaling that combines both approaches. **Horizontal autoscaling** (like HPA) adds or removes pod replicas in seconds to handle traffic spikes, while **vertical rightsizing** continuously optimizes the CPU and memory requests and limits for each container over hours, days, and weeks. Unlike basic VPA tools that conflict with HPA, StormForge uses forecast-based machine learning to harmonize both dimensions. We optimize the resource settings of the pods that sit on your nodes (requests/limits), while tools like Karpenter optimize the nodes themselves. This gives you the best of both worlds – rapid scaling for performance and intelligent rightsizing for cost efficiency.

- How do I know the savings numbers are accurate?

Unlike tools that estimate savings using public list prices, CloudBolt connects your optimization recommendations directly to your actual cloud bills. Savings projections reflect your negotiated rates, committed use discounts, and credits—so the numbers you see are the numbers you'll actually realize.

### Optimization Has a Trust Problem — and a Timing Problem

Engineers don't distrust automation out of stubbornness. They distrust it because when something breaks, they're the ones who get paged.
