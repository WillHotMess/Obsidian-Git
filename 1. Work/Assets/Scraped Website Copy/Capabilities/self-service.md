TESTIMONIALS

## Don't take our word for it

##### Cloudbolt seems to be the most configurable CMP I've seen to date. The product integrates with any service with an API, and the professional services team is quick to add feature enhancements as needed.

##### Gartner Peer Insights Review

##### CloudBolt was accessible yet powerful—it let everyone on our team contribute at their own skill level. We started by just trying to install our software in the cloud, but what we got in return unlocked way more than we ever expected.

##### Ludwig Mueller

Team Lead Cloud Engineering

##### CloudBolt has a well-thought-out user interface and superior extensibility on the orchestration side… The flexibility in providing the framework allowed us to integrate with what was already there without a super heavy lift.

##### Beyond ClickOps: A Better Model for Self-Service at Scale

Somewhere between "do everything manually" and "let everyone do whatever they want," most platform and infrastructure teams now find themselves trying to answer a harder question: How do we enable safe, scalable self-service without losing control of cost, compliance, or complexity?

##### Cloud Management's New Reality: Reading the 2025 Market Map

If you're making platform bets in 2025, the question isn't "Who solves my problem today?" It's "Who's positioned for the problems I can't see yet?"

### FAQs

- How is CloudBolt's self-service different from basic cloud provider catalogs?

Unlike native catalogs that only work in a single ecosystem, CloudBolt provides a unified, cross-cloud catalog with built-in governance, cost controls, and automation—so you can deploy anywhere with consistent processes.

- Can we enforce compliance and budget rules without slowing teams down?

Yes. Policies for security, compliance, and budget limits are embedded into every workflow, so guardrails are automatic and invisible to the end user.

- Does it integrate with our existing approval and ITSM tools?

Absolutely. CloudBolt connects to ServiceNow, Jira, and 200+ other systems, enabling automated approval chains and seamless integration into your existing processes.

- How flexible is the platform for custom requirements?

Extremely. You can script anything in Python, integrate any service with an API, and use Terraform, Ansible, and other IaC tools—making it as open and extensible as you need.
