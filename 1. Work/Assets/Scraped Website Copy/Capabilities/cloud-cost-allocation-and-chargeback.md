### Tag governance that scales

Enforce consistent tagging across millions of resources with automated detection, normalization, and remediation—no more manual audits or endless cleanup projects.

Kubernetes cost allocation

### Accurate Kubernetes costs, down to the container

Stop guessing what your Kubernetes clusters actually cost. CloudBolt allocation traces cloud bills directly to containers, pods, namespaces, and labels—including idle capacity and shared overhead that other tools miss. Works across EKS, AKS, GKE, OpenShift, Rancher, and self-managed clusters with unified FOCUS-compliant reporting.

### Fair shared cost distribution

Split shared resource costs like load balancers and databases based on real usage or customizable rules—not arbitrary spreadsheets.

### Automated cloud chargeback workflows

Generate cloud chargeback and showback reports on autopilot, complete with custom pricing models, audit trails, and integrations with your existing financial systems.

### Follow the money

Visualize every dollar from cloud to container to cost center with interactive Sankey charts that expose misattribution and highlight unallocated waste.

### Visibility into managed cloud services

Crack open the "black box" of managed platforms like OpenShift on AWS, Azure, and GCP—or VMware Cloud—with in-platform agents that expose real utilization.

Real, billed costs, not list

Allocation reflects your actual negotiated rates, committed use discounts, and credits—not on-demand pricing that competitors use to estimate spend.

K8s idle & overhead distribution

Intelligently allocate idle costs, kube-system, monitoring, and networking costs based on proportional usage or custom rules.

FOCUS-compliant output

Export allocation data in industry-standard format for downstream analysis and cross-platform reporting.

TESTIMONIALS

## Don't take our word for it

##### Governance was a huge win for us. We could enforce tagging policies and budget caps that flagged overspending early. That level of control helped us cut cloud waste by over 20%.

##### Direct customer feedback

Anonymized for confidentiality

##### The CloudBolt platform is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive, especially when it came to creating detailed cost allocation dashboards.

##### Direct customer feedback

Anonymized for confidentiality

##### My strategy is multi-cloud so I knew I was going to need something that was going to sit above all the clouds and all the tools. Having one central Multi Cloud solution to get visibility over everything was essential.

### FAQs

- How is CloudBolt's cost attribution different from what cloud providers offer?

Native tools can only attribute costs within their own ecosystem and often rely on incomplete or inconsistent tags. CloudBolt unifies cost data across AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, and Kubernetes—enforcing tagging rules, normalizing metadata, and providing accurate attribution even across shared resources.

- Can you allocate Kubernetes or OpenShift costs down to the container level?

Yes. CloudBolt uses in-cluster metrics to attribute Kubernetes and OpenShift costs accurately, including idle capacity, so teams get a true picture of their usage without guesswork.

- How do you handle shared services like load balancers and databases?

Shared resources can be split using proportional, usage-based, or fully custom rules. This ensures cost distribution is fair, transparent, and backed by audit trails—without resorting to arbitrary spreadsheet formulas.

- Does CloudBolt support automated chargeback and showback?

Absolutely. CloudBolt can generate detailed chargeback or showback reports automatically, complete with custom pricing models and integrations with your financial systems, so you can streamline cost recovery and accountability.
