### FAQs

- How does CloudBolt's continuous optimization work differently from traditional cost reports?

Instead of waiting for monthly or quarterly reviews, CloudBolt executes optimization policies automatically. This eliminates idle resources, rightsizes workloads, and enforces cost priorities in near real time.

- Can it optimize Kubernetes clusters we've already automated with tools like Karpenter?

Yes. StormForge-powered optimization complements existing autoscalers by sizing workloads before they're provisioned, ensuring resources are right-sized at the outset—not just scaled reactively.

- How do we track the ROI of continuous optimization?

CloudBolt measures both projected and realized savings with full attribution. You'll see exactly how each optimization—whether in Kubernetes, public cloud, or private cloud—impacts your bottom line.

- Does it work for private cloud environments like VMware or OpenStack?

Absolutely. CloudBolt applies the same waste detection and automated remediation to VMware and OpenStack, helping you maximize utilization across hybrid and on-premises environments.
