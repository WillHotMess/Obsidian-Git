## The Kubernetes cost visibility gap is real

Your Kubernetes estate is growing—but it still shows up as an opaque line item on your cloud bill. Finance can't allocate costs to business units. Engineering can't identify waste. And nobody can incentivize efficient resource usage.

##### 44% of organizations cannot allocate Kubernetes costs at the workload level

##### 28% report Kubernetes consuming 25-50% of their total cloud spend

##### 91% of leaders say container complexity outpaces their finance team's ability to manage costs

CONTAINER-LEVEL PRECISION

### Real metrics, not approximations

Other tools estimate costs using API queries and assumptions. We deploy an agent that captures actual in-cluster utilization every 15 seconds—the same agent powering our ML optimization—so your allocation reflects what's really happening, not what the control plane thinks is happening.

IDLE & OVERHEAD ALLOCATION

### Account for every dollar—including the waste

Kubernetes clusters have significant costs that can't be directly attributed: idle capacity, kube-system overhead, monitoring agents, networking components. We intelligently distribute these shared costs based on proportional usage or your custom rules—so nothing falls through the cracks.

UNIVERSAL KUBERNETES SUPPORT

### Any distribution. Unified methodology.

EKS, AKS, GKE, OpenShift, Rancher, Tanzu, self-managed—we don't care where you run Kubernetes. Our agent works identically across all distributions, providing consistent FOCUS-compliant allocation regardless of how or where your clusters are deployed.

INTEGRATED OPTIMIZATION

### Connect costs to savings opportunities

We're the only solution where cost allocation and ML-powered optimization share the same data pipeline. See not just what you're spending, but exactly how much each rightsizing recommendation will save—based on your actual negotiated rates, not list prices.

### Feature highlights

Container-level tracking

Allocate costs down to individual containers using real in-cluster metrics captured every 15 seconds.

Real costs, not list prices

Allocation reflects your actual negotiated rates, committed use discounts, and credits—not on-demand pricing that competitors use to estimate spend.

Idle capacity attribution

Intelligently distribute unused resource costs to actual consumers based on proportional usage or custom allocation rules.

### FAQs

- How is this different from what Kubecost provides?

Kubecost provides directional cost estimates based on billing prices. CloudBolt traces actual cloud bills—including your negotiated rates, committed use discounts, and credits—down to the container level. We also provide FOCUS-compliant output for integration with broader FinOps workflows and connect cost data directly to ML-powered optimization recommendations.

- Does this work with our existing Kubernetes setup?

Yes. Our agent deploys via Helm and works across any Kubernetes distribution—EKS, AKS, GKE, OpenShift, Rancher, Tanzu, or self-managed clusters. If you're already using StormForge for optimization, it's the same agent.

- How do you handle shared costs like monitoring and networking?

Idle capacity and overhead costs (kube-system, monitoring agents, networking) can be distributed proportionally based on actual resource consumption, or you can define custom allocation rules that match your business logic.

- What's the difference between this and native cloud provider Kubernetes cost tools?

Native tools only work within their own ecosystem and typically provide namespace-level granularity at best. CloudBolt provides container-level allocation across all clouds with a unified methodology—plus support for on-premises and self-managed clusters that native tools can't touch.

- How long does it take to see results?

Most organizations see full cost visibility within one hour of agent deployment. ML optimization recommendations are available shortly after installation and continually learn to ensure accurate models of your workload patterns.
