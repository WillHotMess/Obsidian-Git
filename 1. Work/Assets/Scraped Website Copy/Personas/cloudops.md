TESTIMONIALS

## Don't take our word for it

##### We plugged CloudBolt into vCenter and it just worked! It was both easier to implement and added more functionality than vRealize Automation (vRA).

IT Manager, Large Federal Agency

##### Rarely does a product offer a "win/win" the way Cloudbolt has. This product has reduced significant overhead for our Operations team while providing our development groups the level of self-service they've desired for a long time.

##### Gartner Peer Insights review

##### With CloudBolt, deployment at Lobster becomes a product: standardized blueprints across all cloud accounts, automated installation, configuration, and updates, plus centralized analytics – reproducible throughout the entire lifecycle. From provisioning through operations and support to controlled decommissioning, we scale the Lobster Cloud and significantly reduce operational and support overhead.
