SERVICE VELOCITY

### From bottleneck to business accelerator

Developers waiting weeks for infra and ops drowning in tickets isn't sustainable. CloudBolt flips the model with governed self-service automation that delivers infrastructure in minutes—so IT becomes the driver of business speed, not the blocker.

TESTIMONIALS

## Don't take our word for it

##### Buying CloudBolt was pretty much a no brainer. I simply said, "Here's the amount of cloud spend we have today. Here's a solution that can help us to control it, especially as we grow the team more to actually support our expanding cloud environment.

##### Jeff Farinich

SVP Technology Services, NAF

##### But essentially what we did was took a process that took them about 48 hours on a really great week, down to about three or four minutes to deliver a full workload with security built-in.

##### IBM

##### CloudBolt was accessible yet powerful—it let everyone on our team contribute at their own skill level. We started by just trying to install our software in the cloud, but what we got in return unlocked way more than we ever expected.

##### Ludwig Mueller

Team Lead Cloud Engineering

##### CloudBolt is completely aligned with what we need to deliver and the speed at which we need to operate. They understand our customer's and that's our business.

##### Mohit Sharma, CTO
