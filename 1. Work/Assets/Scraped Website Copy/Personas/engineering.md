ZERO-TOUCH OPERATIONS

### Deployments that handle themselves

Launch pre-approved blueprints with just a click or commit. CloudBolt provisions infrastrucure across any cloud with built-in tagging, governance, and cost controls—no tickets, no manual configs, no delays.

DAY-2 AUTOMATION

### Ops work that runs on autopilot

Automate recurring ops tasks like patching, backups, scaling, cert rotation. Turn toil into policy-driven workflows that execute reliably so engineers can stop babysitting environments.

CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION

### Performance tuning without the toil

Get AI-powered rightsizing for Kubernetes workloads, VM optimization, and automated power scheduling—all without manual tuning. Your workloads stay fast and efficient while your engineers stay focused.

Self-service infrastructure without the bottlenecks

Engineers get resources instantly through governed portals—complete with automated ServiceNow ticketing and policy-driven approval chains. No more ticket backlogs, just secure, compliant deployments in minutes.

Kubernetes complexity management

HPA adds replicas to meet CPU demand, VPA lowers requests to optimize usage—and the result is instability and app failures. CloudBolt's bi-dimensional scaling harmonizes both vertical and horizontal autoscaling to prevent churn, reduce overprovisioning, and keep workloads running smoothly.

Backlog & ticket elimination

Turn manual ops requests into automated policies. Refreshes, reconfigs, rightsizing, idle cleanup—they all run on autopilot, not in JIRA.

Java workload optimization

Rightsize JVM workloads with precision. CloudBolt augments heap metrics to properly set max heap sizes—optimizing both container memory limits and application performance. Eliminate OOMKills, reduce memory waste, and improve stability for your Java services.

Cost visibility without blame

See deployment-level cost in real-time. Get pre-deployment estimates, stay within budget, and avoid finger-pointing—without sacrificing performance.

Tool consolidation

Integrate your existing stack—Terraform, Ansible, GitOps, ServiceNow—with 200+ native connectors. One platform. Zero silos.

TESTIMONIALS

## Don't take our word for it

##### With CloudBolt you just hit a button and provisioning orchestration just happens… That whole process used to be multiple manual ones taking weeks… now we've been able to reduce that to mere minutes!

##### IT Manager

Large Federal Agency

##### As you can write any arbitrary python code, you can perform pretty much any action you want, when someone orders a service. For now we could achieve to fulfill all of our requirements including compliance and governance topics.

##### Gartner Peer Insights review

##### Thanks to CloudBolt, our software engineering teams are happy customers, and they're effectively supporting our business applications.
