### **Section 1: Setting the Stage (The First 5 Seconds)**

_Focus on the content "above the fold" that creates the critical first impression._

|#|Guiding Question|Core Principle (Why it Matters)|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|What **market category** are we placing our product in with our headline, and does this choice make our unique strengths obvious?|Your headline sets the context. A good category choice makes your value instantly understandable; a bad one creates confusion.|
|**2**|Does the sub-header immediately identify **who this is for** and hint at the primary **value** they will receive?|Attract your "best-fit" customers and signal the core benefit right away. This acts as a powerful filter.|
|**3**|Does the hero section's content (text and visuals) pass the **"quacks like a duck" test** for our chosen market category?|Your design and tone must match the expectations of your declared market. Mismatches erode trust.|

### **Section 2: The Core Narrative (Building the Case)**

_Focus on the body of the page that builds the persuasive argument for your solution._

# The 'Obviously Awesome' Website: 15 Guiding Questions for a Strategically-Sound Rewrite

## Introduction: Your Website is Your Positioning Made Real

A corporate website is far more than a digital brochure or a collection of marketing assets. It is the most critical, public-facing manifestation of a company's positioning strategy. For the vast majority of prospects, the website is the first point of contact—the silent salesperson that works 24/7 to set the context for the product and the company. If that context is confusing, weak, or misaligned with the product's true value, even the most innovative offering will struggle to be understood, let alone purchased.1

The process of rewriting a website should therefore be viewed not as a design or copywriting exercise, but as a strategic implementation of a well-defined position. The central goal is to make the product _obviously awesome_ to the right people, instantly and intuitively. This requires moving beyond subjective feedback ("I don't like this color") to an objective, strategy-aligned evaluation.

A useful framework for this evaluation is to think of a website's homepage as the opening scene of a movie.1 Within seconds, a visitor must be able to answer a series of implicit questions: Where am I? What is this thing? Who is it for? Why should I care? Is this a serious, enterprise-grade solution or a fun, disruptive tool? The website's design, language, and structure provide the crucial clues that allow the visitor to frame the product correctly. As April Dunford states, "Context enables people to figure out what's important".1 Without the right context, a product is simply noise.

This report provides a set of 15 guiding questions derived solely from the principles articulated in _Obviously Awesome: How to Nail Product Positioning so Customers Get It, Buy It, Love It_. These questions are designed to serve as a rigorous audit tool for every block and page of a new website, ensuring that the final product is not merely an aesthetic improvement, but a powerful engine for making a company's unique value clear, compelling, and immediately understandable to its ideal customers.

## Part I: The Foundational Framework for a Strategically-Sound Website

Before applying specific questions to website content, the entire team must align on the foundational principles that underpin an effective, positioning-led website. This shared understanding ensures that all execution—from headline writing to image selection—is grounded in the same strategic intent.

### Chapter 1: From Our Baggage to Their Context

Product creators are often their own worst enemies when it comes to positioning. They fall into one of two traps: they remain stuck on the idea of what they _intended_ to build, failing to see that the product has evolved into something else; or they are so focused on their product that they miss crucial shifts in the market around them.1 A company's website is often the primary stage where this internal "positioning baggage"—the history, the founder's original vision, the internal jargon—is displayed to the world.1

The core challenge is that market confusion begins with the disconnect between how creators understand their product and how customers first perceive it.1 A website must be the primary mechanism for bridging this gap. It must actively release the company's internal baggage and adopt a context that is instantly meaningful to a first-time visitor who knows nothing of the product's history.

This principle of positioning as context-setting is the most fundamental concept for a website rewrite. Consider two of Dunford's key illustrations:

- **Joshua Bell in the subway:** The world-renowned violinist Joshua Bell, playing a multi-million dollar violin, earned just $32.17 as a street performer in a subway station. The product (his music) was world-class, but the context (a subway station, a man in a baseball cap) signaled that it was not valuable. A website's design, language, and overall presentation create this context. A brilliant enterprise product presented on a cheap-looking, amateurish website will be perceived as a low-value, untrustworthy solution.1
    
- **Cake vs. Muffins vs. Cake Pops:** A product made from cake batter can be positioned as a "cake," a "muffin," or a "cake pop." This is not a trivial semantic choice; it is a fundamental business decision. Each choice of market category changes everything: the competitive alternatives (other cakes vs. donuts vs. lollipops), the target buyer (celebration vs. breakfast vs. snack), the price point, and the key features. A website's main headline is the moment it declares to the world, "We are a cake," "We are a muffin," or "We are a cake pop." If that declaration is wrong, the visitor is immediately confused.1
    

The website rewrite is the most powerful opportunity for a company to publicly and definitively let go of its baggage. Every word, every image, and every structural choice must be evaluated through the lens of a new visitor. The team must constantly ask if they are writing for themselves and their own history, or for the customer and their immediate need for clarity.

### Chapter 2: The Five (Plus One) Components of a Winning Web Page

Effective positioning can be deconstructed into a set of core components. These components, outlined by Dunford, serve as a strategic blueprint for the essential elements that every key page of a website—especially the homepage—must communicate, either explicitly or implicitly.1

1. **Competitive Alternatives:** A winning page must acknowledge what the customer is _actually_ comparing the product to. This is rarely a direct competitor's product. More often, it is "using a spreadsheet," "hiring an intern," or simply "doing nothing and suffering with the problem".1 The website must frame the problem in a way that shows the inadequacy of these true alternatives.
    
2. **Unique Attributes:** The page must clearly showcase the specific features and capabilities that the product has and the alternatives lack. These are the "secret sauce".1
    
3. **Value (and Proof):** This is the most critical translation step. The page must articulate the tangible, desirable benefit that the unique attributes enable for customers. Crucially, this value must be substantiated with proof—customer quotes, data points, case studies—to be believable.1
    
4. **Target Market Characteristics:** The page's language, examples, and imagery must act as a "dog whistle" for the ideal customer. It should make them feel, "This is for me." This is achieved by speaking their language and reflecting their specific world, which in turn signals to poor-fit customers that the product is likely not for them.1
    
5. **Market Category:** The page must immediately signal the "box" the customer should put the product in. This frame of reference triggers a host of powerful assumptions about competitors, features, and pricing. Choosing the right category makes the product's value obvious; choosing the wrong one forces the website to waste precious attention correcting false assumptions.1
    
6. **(Bonus) Relevant Trends:** Optionally, the page can layer on a relevant trend to create urgency and answer the unasked question, "Why is this important _right now_?" This connects the product to a larger movement or shift that the customer already understands and cares about.1
    

A successful web page is one where these components work in harmony to create a clear, compelling, and persuasive narrative for the target visitor.

## Part II: The 15 Guiding Questions for Content Creation and Review

The following 15 questions operationalize the principles of _Obviously Awesome_ into a practical checklist for creating and reviewing website content. They are grouped into four sections that mirror a visitor's journey through a page: the initial impression, the core argument, the call to action, and the fine-grained details.

### Section 1: Setting the Stage (The First 5 Seconds)

These questions focus on the hero section of a page—the content "above the fold"—which determines in seconds whether a visitor will stay or leave.

The single most important positioning decision is the choice of market category, and the website's headline is the primary point of delivery for this choice. As illustrated by Dunford's "database vs. data warehouse" story, a poor category choice forces a company to spend its time explaining what it is _not_, rather than what it _is_ and why it is valuable.1 A website has no time for such clarifications. The initial framing must be correct, as it creates the context for everything that follows.

**Q1: What market category are we placing our product in with our headline, and does this category choice make our unique strengths immediately obvious?**

- **Principle:** This question directly enforces Step 8 of the positioning process: finding a market frame of reference that puts the product's strengths at the center.1
    
- **Execution:** The main H1 headline must name or strongly imply a market category (e.g., "Accounting Software," "Team Collaboration," "Direct-to-Consumer Sampling"). The team must then rigorously analyze the assumptions this category triggers. Does it bring to mind the right competitors? Does it create expectations about features and pricing that the product can meet and exceed? If the chosen category frames the product as a weaker version of an established leader or obscures its key differentiators, the headline—and the positioning—is broken. For example, positioning a secure file-sharing tool as "Email for Lawyers" was a failure because it lacked core email features like a calendar, creating disappointment. Repositioning it as "Team Collaboration Software" made its value obvious.1
    

**Q2: Does the sub-header immediately identify who this is for and hint at the primary value they will receive?**

- **Principle:** This combines Step 7 (determine who cares a lot) and Step 6 (map attributes to value).1
    
- **Execution:** The H2 or primary sub-header should qualify the audience and state the key outcome. It should speak directly to the target segment: "For growing creative agencies," "For remote-first engineering teams," "For founders of small businesses." It should then connect this audience to the core value proposition: "...that want to streamline client approvals and get paid faster." This dual function acts as a powerful filter, attracting the right visitors and signaling to the wrong ones that they can move on.
    

**Q3: Does the hero section's content (text and visuals) pass the "quacks like a duck" test for our chosen market category?**

- **Principle:** This applies the concept of abductive reasoning—if it looks, swims, and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck—to the website's presentation.1
    
- **Execution:** The visual language and tone of the hero section must align with the expectations of the chosen market category. If the headline declares "Enterprise-Grade Cybersecurity," the design should feel robust, secure, and professional, using imagery of data centers or security operations centers. If the headline declares "A Fun Way to Learn a New Language," the design can be colorful, playful, and use illustrations of people happily interacting. A mismatch between the declared category and the visual presentation creates cognitive dissonance and erodes the visitor's trust before they have read a single feature.
    

### Section 2: The Core Narrative (Building the Case)

Once the stage is set, the body of the page must build a persuasive case. The most effective websites follow a logical narrative structure that guides the visitor from problem to solution. Persuasion is not just about presenting facts, but presenting them in the right order. A customer must agree they have a problem and that existing solutions are flawed before they will be open to hearing about a new one. Dunford's "sales story" framework provides the ideal narrative spine for a website's main pages.1 This arc—Problem, Flawed Solutions, The Gap, Your Solution, Value Themes—is a time-tested persuasive sequence. The following questions audit the content against this narrative structure.

**Q4: Do we clearly name the customer's _actual_ competitive alternative, not just our direct product competitors?**

- **Principle:** This is the foundation of the entire positioning flow, based on Step 4: list your _true_ competitive alternatives.1
    
- **Execution:** The website copy must explicitly address the alternative that is top-of-mind for the customer. For many products, this is not another software vendor but a manual process. The page should contain sections with headings like, "Still managing projects in messy spreadsheets?" or "Tired of tracking customer feedback in a shared inbox?" By naming the real pain associated with the true alternative, the website validates the customer's current struggle and opens them up to a better way.
    

**Q5: For every unique feature we mention, have we immediately translated it into customer value?**

- **Principle:** This enforces the crucial link between Step 5 (Unique Attributes) and Step 6 (Value), avoiding the "So what?" problem where a feature is mentioned without its benefit.1
    
- **Execution:** This is a rule with no exceptions. Never list a feature without its corresponding value proposition. Instead of writing, "Our product has a 15-megapixel camera," write, "Take photos so sharp and detailed they look amazing even when you zoom in or print them large".1 Instead of, "We integrate with QuickBooks," write, "Automate your bookkeeping and save hours of manual data entry by connecting directly to QuickBooks."
    

**Q6: Is every claim of value on this page backed up by concrete, believable proof in close proximity?**

- **Principle:** This enforces the "(and proof)" part of the Value component. A claim without proof is just marketing fluff.1 Opinions do not count as proof; data and third-party validation do.1
    
- **Execution:** Value claims must be immediately substantiated. If the copy states, "Reduce customer churn," it should be followed by a customer quote ("Since implementing, our churn has dropped by 15%"), a logo of a happy customer, or a mini-case study with a specific metric. Proof should be woven directly into the narrative, not relegated to a separate "Testimonials" page that many visitors will never click on.
    

**Q7: Does our language speak exclusively to our "best-fit" customer segment, even if it risks alienating others?**

- **Principle:** This is the practical application of Step 7, which involves focusing on the characteristics of customers who buy quickly, rarely ask for discounts, and become raving fans.1
    
- **Execution:** The website must choose a side. Trying to appeal to everyone results in appealing to no one. The copy should use the industry jargon, reference the specific pains, and use examples that only the best-fit segment would deeply understand and appreciate. When a CRM was repositioned for investment banks, the team started using terms like "deal flow" and "compliance" in their pitches. This language would be meaningless to a retail business, but for a banker, it was a powerful signal that the company truly understood their world.1
    

**Q8: Are we clearly playing one of the three games: "Head to Head," "Big Fish, Small Pond," or "Create a New Game"?**

- **Principle:** A company must make a conscious strategic choice about how it intends to win in a market, as outlined in Step 8.1 The website's narrative must be consistent with this choice.
    
- **Execution:** The page's overall story must align with one of these three styles:
    
    - **Head to Head:** The narrative is, "Here is the established market you know. Here is the market leader. And here is the undeniable proof of why we are superior on the criteria you already care about."
        
    - **Big Fish, Small Pond:** The narrative is, "You are familiar with the, but as a, your needs are unique and are not being met by the general-purpose leaders. We were built from the ground up just for you."
        
    - **Create a New Game:** The narrative is, "The world has changed [due to a major technological or social shift]. The old ways of solving this problem are now obsolete. A new category of solution is now possible and necessary, and here's why it's a strategic imperative for your business."
        

### Section 3: Creating Urgency and Driving Action (The "Why Now?")

A website that merely informs is a failure. It must persuade the visitor that action is required. The question "Why now?" 1, which is essential for category creation, is a powerful tool for creating urgency in any positioning style. Customers are inert; a product that is simply "better" may not be enough to overcome the friction of change. A product that is "better"

_and_ helps them capitalize on a current trend or mitigate a pressing threat is far more compelling.

**Q9: Does this page give the visitor a compelling reason why they should solve this problem _right now_?**

- **Principle:** This operationalizes Step 9, "Layer On a Trend (but Be Careful)".1 It connects the product's value to a timely, external force.
    
- **Execution:** The copy should link the product's benefits to a trend the target customer already recognizes and cares about. For example: "With the global shift to remote work, ensuring seamless and secure team collaboration has never been more critical." Or, "New data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA mean you can no longer afford to manage customer data in unsecured spreadsheets." This creates urgency by framing the purchase not as an optional improvement, but as a necessary response to a changing world.
    

**Q10: Is the call-to-action (CTA) a logical next step that reduces friction for our target customer?**

- **Principle:** This is a practical application of understanding the customer's journey and mindset, an implicit theme throughout the book's focus on customer-centricity.
    
- **Execution:** The CTA must match the visitor's level of commitment and knowledge at that point on the page. A first-time visitor to a complex enterprise product is rarely ready to "Buy Now." A more appropriate CTA would be "Request a Demo," "Watch a 2-Minute Overview," or "Talk to a Solutions Expert." The CTA should feel like a helpful, low-risk next step on their evaluation journey, not a high-pressure, final demand.
    

### Section 4: The Granular Review (Auditing Blocks and Sentences)

These final questions are designed for the micro-level review of individual content blocks, paragraphs, and even single sentences to ensure every word serves the overall strategy.

**Q11: Does this block/sentence reinforce our core value themes, or is it a distraction?**

- **Principle:** This enforces the focus that comes from clustering value into a few key themes, as described in Step 6.1
    
- **Execution:** A strong position is focused. The website should be built around one to four core value clusters. Every piece of content—every paragraph, every bullet point—should support one of these themes. If it does not, it is likely noise that dilutes the core message and should be cut.
    

**Q12: Is this written from the customer's point of view, or is it "we-we" copy?**

- **Principle:** This enforces the deep customer-centricity that is the hallmark of the entire _Obviously Awesome_ methodology.1
    
- **Execution:** A simple but powerful test is to scan the copy for the words "we," "our," and the company name. These should be minimized. Rephrase sentences to begin with "You" or to focus on the customer's outcome. Instead of, "Our software has an advanced reporting feature," write, "You can generate detailed reports in seconds to understand your business better."
    

**Q13: Have we used a simpler, more direct word where a complex or jargony one exists?**

- **Principle:** The goal is to be "obviously awesome," which requires being "obviously understandable".1 Complexity is the enemy of clarity.
    
- **Execution:** Ruthlessly eliminate business jargon and ten-dollar words. Replace "leverage" with "use." Replace "ideate" with "create" or "think." Replace "synergize" with "work together." The goal is to communicate an idea as quickly and clearly as possible, not to sound sophisticated.
    

**Q14: Could a competitor truthfully make this exact same statement?**

- **Principle:** This is a sharp test for true differentiation, enforcing the focus on _unique_ attributes and value.1
    
- **Execution:** Scrutinize every generic claim, such as "We offer world-class customer support" or "Our software is easy to use." If a competitor could place that sentence on their website without it being a lie, the statement is not a differentiator and carries no weight with a skeptical prospect. It must be rephrased to be specific, unique, and provable: "Our 24/7 support guarantees a human response in under 5 minutes," or "Get started in minutes with our one-click installation, no training required."
    

**Q15: Does this page reflect our _customer_ positioning, not our _investor_ positioning?**

- **Principle:** This enforces the crucial distinction Dunford makes between the two audiences. Investors are buying a future vision; customers are buying a solution to a problem they have right now.1
    
- **Execution:** The website is for customers. Its copy must avoid grand, abstract, 10-year visionary statements about "disrupting the paradigm" or "building the platform for the future of X." This is investor-speak. The website must focus relentlessly on the immediate, tangible value the product delivers to a customer today.
    

## Part III: A Practical Toolkit for Implementation

Having a strategic framework and a list of questions is necessary but not sufficient. To ensure these principles are applied consistently throughout the website rewrite process, a tactical tool is required to bridge the gap between strategy and day-to-day execution.

### Chapter 3: The Page and Block Review Checklist

The 15 guiding questions can be transformed into a simple, repeatable checklist for reviewing content drafts. This structured process moves feedback from the realm of subjective opinion to objective, strategy-based analysis. It creates a shared language for the team and makes the revision process faster and more effective by pinpointing exactly _why_ a piece of content is not working and what must be done to fix it.

The following table provides a template for this "Obviously Awesome" Content Audit. It forces a reviewer to score a content block's alignment with the strategy and to ground their revision notes in the specific principles from Dunford's book.

|Content Block / Page Section|Relevant Guiding Question(s)|Alignment Score (1-5)|Notes & Action Items for Revision (Grounded in Dunford's principles)|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Homepage Hero Section**|Q1, Q2, Q7|2|**Q1:** Headline "The Future of Work" is a trend, not a market category. It's confusing and could apply to anyone. We must declare our category: "Project Management Software for Remote Agencies." **Q7:** Sub-header "For teams of all sizes" is too broad and generic. It must speak directly to our best-fit segment.|
|**"Why Us vs. Spreadsheets" Section**|Q4, Q5, Q6|5|Excellent. **Q4:** Directly calls out the pain of "managing client projects in endless spreadsheet tabs." **Q5:** Connects the "centralized comments" feature to the value of "never losing a piece of client feedback." **Q6:** Includes a customer quote with a specific metric right below the value statement.|
|**Features Page Block: "Reporting"**|Q5, Q12, Q14|3|**Q5:** Lists features ("custom dashboards," "PDF exports") but fails to translate them to value. Revise to focus on the outcome: "Get the insights you need to keep projects on budget and clients happy." **Q12:** Too much "we-we" copy ("Our reports give you..."). Rephrase to "You can see..." **Q14:** The claim "powerful reporting" is generic. Be specific.|
|**Pricing Page**|Q8, Q15|4|**Q8:** The feature breakdown by tier clearly supports our "Big Fish, Small Pond" strategy by highlighting the advanced collaboration features our agency subsegment cares about most in the higher tiers. **Q15:** Good focus on current value delivered at each price point, with no abstract investor-speak.|

## Conclusion: Positioning is a Living Strategy

The completion of a website rewrite is not the end of the positioning journey. It is the beginning of a new phase of testing and refinement. As Dunford emphasizes, positioning is not a one-time event. It must be revisited every six months, or whenever there is a major event that could impact the competitive landscape or customer perceptions.1 These events can include the entry of a new competitor, a shift in government regulations, a change in economic priorities, or the emergence of a new technology.

The website itself becomes a critical feedback loop for this ongoing process. Analytics data, such as high bounce rates on pages with weak positioning or low conversion rates on specific CTAs, can signal a disconnect. Customer support tickets and sales call recordings provide a rich source of qualitative data, revealing the language customers use to describe their problems and their understanding (or misunderstanding) of the product's value.

By using the 15 guiding questions in this report, a team can ensure their new website is a powerful, strategic asset that makes their product obviously awesome from the very first click. By treating that website as a living experiment, they can ensure their positioning remains sharp, relevant, and effective as markets inevitably evolve.
