## Summary
Steve Francis presented a first call playbook for CloudBolt's sales process, focusing on establishing credibility, proper discovery, and effective information gathering. The team aligned on a new approach for handling inbound leads, with AEs taking a more active role in initial calls while setting SLA expectations (5 business days). They also discussed potential prospecting initiatives for later in Q3 that Caleb could help lead.

## Agenda
- Review the first call playbook framework
- Clarify roles between Caleb and AEs for inbound leads
- Establish SLAs for lead response
- Discuss future prospecting initiatives

## Discussion Notes
- Steve presented a one-page playbook on conducting first calls, emphasizing:
    - Setting an agenda at the beginning to take control of the meeting
    - Providing a brief CloudBolt overview to establish credibility (2-3 minutes)
    - Using open-ended discovery questions that funnel to specifics
    - Expanding scope to include additional CloudBolt products
    - Keeping product demos optional and brief to leave prospects wanting more
- Current process has Caleb handling most first calls, but going forward:
    - AEs should take ownership of initial calls using the playbook
    - Caleb will coordinate scheduling between leads and AEs
    - If scheduling with an AE would exceed 5 business days, Caleb can run the call himself
    - SEs should not be on these initial discovery calls
- Steve outlined a future prospecting initiative:
    - Low quantity, high quality approach
    - 4-5 target accounts per seller
    - In-depth research on prospects ("learn so much about them that it's creepy")
    - Multiple touch points required (7-8 interactions typically needed)
    - William mentioned some prospecting work already underway
