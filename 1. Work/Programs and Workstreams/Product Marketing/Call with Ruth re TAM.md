**Subject: Key Takeaways & Next Steps from our Market Sizing Call with Ruth (Insight)**

Hi Team,

Met Ruth this morning. 

Ruth acknowledged the logic of our top-down model (Global Cloud Spend > IaaS/PaaS > etc.) for a high-level TAM. However, she strongly advocated for a parallel **bottoms-up approach** to get a more accurate take. Her view is that starting with our own channel partners, BillOps customers, and sales pipeline data will ground our forecast in what we can realistically obtain.

**2. The 70% Indirect Assumption is Our Biggest Risk:**  
This was our most significant point of discussion. Ruth agreed that applying the general "70% of IT spend is indirect" figure to cloud procurement feels **too high**. We both suspect the actual rate for cloud is lower, but there is no publicly available data to confirm this. Validating this assumption is our most critical next step.

**3. We Need to Define the "Why":**  
Ruth raised an excellent question: what is the primary goal of this market sizing exercise? Is it to produce a high-level TAM for an investor deck, or is it to create a functional task to drive our GTM strategy and sales targets? The answer dictates the level of precision we need and which methodology is most appropriate.

**Proposed Next Steps**

**Data Validation & Primary Research:**
- **Customer/Partner Outreach:** Who can connect with our key BillOps partners (like Giacom) to ask how they view their TAM, the data they use, and their biggest competition? 
- **Hyperscaler Inquiry:** Can we leverage contacts at AWS (Ross, other) to socialize the question internally and see if we can get any data (even if anecdotal) on their direct vs. indirect business split? 
- **Insight's Network:** Ruth has offered to ask around within her network (consulting firms, other portfolio companies) and see if Insight has access to any proprietary research on this topic.

Once we have gathered more data from these sources, we can refine our assumptions and build a more robust model that combines the best of the top-down and bottoms-up approaches.

Happy to discuss this further.

Best,

William Norton
