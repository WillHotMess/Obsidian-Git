# **Unlock FinOps Visibility for Hosted OpenShift & AVS Environments**

## Transform "Specialized Compute" Black Boxes into Actionable Cloud Intelligence

### **The Challenge: When Cloud Optimization Goes Dark**

Enterprise organizations are rapidly adopting managed platforms like Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), and Azure VMware Solution (AVS) for their ease of migration and operational benefits. However, these platforms create a critical blind spot in cloud financial management:

- **Zero Granular Visibility**: Cloud providers report these as generic "Specialized Compute" line items
- **Broken FinOps Practices**: No resource-level data means no cost allocation, chargeback, or optimization
- **Million-Dollar Black Boxes**: Organizations spending $1M+ monthly have no insight into actual resource utilization
- **Lost Business Context**: Unable to map costs to teams, applications, or business units

_One enterprise customer reported $1.45M in monthly AVS spend with absolutely no visibility into what resources were consuming these costs._

### **The CloudBolt Solution: From Black Box to Business Intelligence**

CloudBolt transforms opaque "Specialized Compute" costs into granular, actionable insights through our innovative **OpenShift & AVS Cost Allocation** capability:

**üîç Deep Visibility Through CloudBolt Agent**

- Deploys seamlessly within OpenShift, AVS, and ARO environments
- Collects granular utilization metrics at the pod, VM, and container level
- Preserves business context through tag inheritance and mapping

**üìä Intelligent Cost Allocation**

- Automatically correlates usage data with actual cloud billing
- Applies reserved instance discounts and commitment rates accurately
- Distributes costs based on actual resource consumption, not estimates

**üí° Restored FinOps Capabilities**

- **Cost Allocation**: Track costs by pod, namespace, cluster, and business dimensions
- **Chargeback/Showback**: Enable accurate departmental billing with full audit trails
- **Optimization**: Identify underutilized resources and rightsizing opportunities
- **Commitment Management**: See what's reserved vs. on-demand within these platforms

### **How It Works**

1. **Deploy CloudBolt Agent** in your OpenShift/AVS environment (non-intrusive, read-only)
2. **Automatic Discovery** of all workloads, pods, VMs, and their resource utilization
3. **Intelligent Mapping** correlates usage with AWS/Azure billing data
4. **Business Context Integration** through CloudBolt's group tagging framework
5. **Actionable Reporting** via interactive Sankey charts and detailed cost breakdowns
