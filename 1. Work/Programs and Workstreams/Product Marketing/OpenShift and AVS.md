# Master Your Multi-Cloud VMware & OpenShift Spend with CloudBolt

### The Managed Platform Blind Spot in Your Cloud Strategy

Managed platforms like **Red Hat OpenShift (on AWS, Azure, and GCP)** and hosted VMware environments such as **Azure VMware Solution (AVS), Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE), and VMware Cloud on AWS** promise operational simplicity and accelerated cloud adoption. Yet this abstraction creates a critical blind spot in your multi-cloud financial management:

- **Zero Granular Visibility:** Cloud providers report these complex services as generic, aggregated line items.
    
- **Broken FinOps Practices:** No resource-level data means no cost allocation, chargeback, or optimization.
    
- **Expensive Black Boxes:** Organizations spending millions annually have no insight into actual resource utilization across their cloud footprint.
    
- **Lost Business Context:** You're unable to map costs to the specific teams, applications, or business units that consume them.
    
- **Broken Accountability:** Finance teams are forced to abandon data-driven allocation for guesswork.
    

This isn't just a reporting problem—it's a strategic blind spot that compounds daily, undermining your cloud ROI and financial governance.

### Why Traditional FinOps Tools Fail at Hybrid Cloud

The architectural design of managed platforms bundles compute, storage, networking, and management overhead into a single consumable service. This creates fundamental limitations for most tools:

- **Native Cloud Tools (AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, Google Cloud Billing)** can only report what providers bill—the total black box cost.
    
- **Red Hat's Own Cost Management** acknowledges significant "unallocated" buckets it cannot distribute.
    
- **Finance-Centric Platforms** often rely on estimation models and static ratios rather than actual utilization.
    
- **Engineering Point Solutions** like Kubecost only solve for Kubernetes, creating tool sprawl and data silos in a hybrid cloud environment.
    

**The root cause:** These solutions depend on flawed data sources (aggregated billing files) rather than ground-truth utilization metrics from within the platforms themselves.

### CloudBolt's Architectural Advantage: The Agent as Your "Key"

CloudBolt transforms opaque managed platform costs into granular business intelligence:

**Ground-Truth Data Collection**

- Our agent-based architecture captures real-time metrics directly from within your VMware and OpenShift environments, no matter which cloud they run on.
    
- Measures actual CPU, memory, and storage utilization at the VM, pod, and container level.
    
- Goes beyond the bill to solve allocation at the source, where API-only tools fail.
    

**Intelligent Cost Correlation**

- Applies your true blended rates, including Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, and Enterprise Agreements.
    
- Distributes costs based on direct utilization metrics, not imprecise ratio-based estimates.
    
- Transforms "unallocated" spend from a black hole into a quantified, manageable optimization target.
    

**Business Context Preservation**

- Maps your internal tags and labels to utilization data for meaningful attribution.
    
- Enables allocation by team, application, project, or any business dimension.
    
- Creates a single source of truth for both your managed OpenShift and hosted VMware environments, regardless of the underlying cloud provider.
    

### Visually Trace Every Cloud Dollar with Interactive Sankey Reporting

Static spreadsheets and tables aren't enough to understand complex cloud costs. CloudBolt moves beyond them, allowing you to see your spend in a way no other tool can.

Our interactive Sankey charts tell a dynamic, visual story of your cost allocation.

- **Follow the Money:** Instantly trace the flow of every dollar from the total platform cost down to the individual cluster, namespace, pod, and business owner. The width of the flow visually represents the cost magnitude, immediately drawing your eye to the largest areas of spend.
    
- **Spotlight Untagged Waste:** The **Allocation Funnel** is a powerful diagnostic tool that shows the exact percentage of your spend that is successfully tagged and allocated at each step of the hierarchy. If 100% of your costs are allocated to a cluster but only 60% are allocated to a business leader, you’ve instantly quantified a 40% gap in your financial accountability.
    
- **Customize Your View:** Dynamically change segmentation points to analyze costs from different perspectives. Understand spend by application, then instantly pivot to view it by cost center or environment without ever leaving the dashboard.
    

This isn't just a report; it's an interactive map of your cloud financial health, pinpointing waste and optimization opportunities in real-time.

### Enterprise Integration: Operationalizing Your FinOps Data

CloudBolt moves beyond standalone reporting to embed financial intelligence into your core enterprise workflows:

- **Bi-Directional ServiceNow Integration:** Automatically enrich your CMDB with real-time resource costs and trigger cost-aware incident tickets and change requests.
    
- **Power Your Business Intelligence:** Export granular data via comprehensive REST APIs to blend cloud costs with business metrics and calculate true unit economics.
    
- **Enable "Shift-Left" FinOps:** Inject cost awareness directly into CI/CD pipelines to implement budgetary guardrails _before_ deployment.
