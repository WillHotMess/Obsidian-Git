**Unlock FinOps Visibility for Hosted OpenShift & AVS Environments**

## Transform Hosted OpenShift and AVS Black Boxes into Actionable Cloud Intelligence

### **The Challenge: When Cloud Optimization Goes Dark**

Enterprise organizations are rapidly adopting managed platforms like Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), and Azure VMware Solution (AVS) for their ease of migration and operational benefits. However, these platforms create a critical blind spot in cloud financial management:

- **Zero Granular Visibility**: Cloud providers report these as generic "Specialized Compute" line items
- **Broken FinOps Practices**: No resource-level data means no cost allocation, chargeback, or optimization
- **Million-Dollar Black Boxes**: Organizations spending millions annually have no insight into actual resource utilization
- **Lost Business Context**: Unable to map costs to teams, applications, or business units

_One enterprise customer reported $1.45M in monthly AVS spend with absolutely no visibility into what resources were consuming these costs._

### **The CloudBolt Solution: From Black Box to Business Intelligence**

CloudBolt transforms opaque costs into granular, actionable insights through our innovative **OpenShift & AVS Cost Allocation** capability:

**üîç Deep Visibility Through CloudBolt Agent**
- Deploys seamlessly within OpenShift, AVS, and ARO environments
- Collects granular utilization metrics at the pod, VM, and container level
- Preserves business context through tag inheritance and mapping

**üìä Intelligent Cost Allocation**
- Automatically correlates usage data with actual cloud billing
- Applies reserved instance discounts and commitment rates accurately
- Distributes costs based on actual resource consumption, not estimates

**üí° Restored FinOps Capabilities**
- **Cost Allocation**: Track costs by pod, namespace, cluster, and business dimensions
- **Chargeback/Showback**: Enable accurate departmental billing with full audit trails
- **Optimization**: Identify underutilized resources and rightsizing opportunities
- **Commitment Management**: See what's reserved vs. on-demand within these platforms

### **How It Works**
1. **Deploy CloudBolt Agent** in your OpenShift/AVS environment (non-intrusive, read-only)
2. **Automatic Discovery** of all workloads, pods, VMs, and their resource utilization
3. **Intelligent Mapping** correlates usage with AWS/Azure billing data
4. **Business Context Integration** through CloudBolt's group tagging framework
5. **Actionable Reporting** via interactive Sankey charts and detailed cost breakdowns

### **Proven Business Impact**
‚úì **100% Cost Attribution** - Eliminate unallocated "Specialized Compute" spend  
‚úì **83% Reduction** in manual allocation efforts through automation  
‚úì **Granular Chargeback** - Bill departments based on actual consumption  
‚úì **Optimization Enabled** - Turn on/off resources based on real usage patterns

## Master Your AVS & OpenShift Spend with CloudBolt's Augmented FinOps Platform

### **The Multi-Million Dollar Blind Spot in Your Cloud Strategy**

Managed platforms like Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA), Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), and Azure VMware Solution (AVS) promise operational simplicity and accelerated cloud adoption. Yet this abstraction creates a critical financial governance failure: these services appear as opaque "Specialized Compute" line items on your cloud bill, rendering traditional FinOps practices ineffective.

**The Real Cost of Opacity:**
- **$1.45M Monthly Black Box**: One enterprise's actual AVS spend with zero visibility into resource allocation
- **44% of Organizations** rely on error-prone manual estimates for Kubernetes cost allocation
- **30%+ Potential Savings** locked away due to inability to identify optimization opportunities
- **Broken Accountability**: Finance teams forced to abandon data-driven allocation for guesswork

*This isn't just a reporting problem‚Äîit's a strategic blind spot that compounds daily, undermining your cloud ROI and financial governance.*

### **Why Traditional FinOps Tools Fail at Specialized Compute**

The architectural design of managed platforms bundles compute, storage, networking, and management overhead into a single consumable service. This creates fundamental limitations:

**Native Cloud Tools** (AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management) can only report what providers bill‚Äîthe total black box cost
**Red Hat's Own Cost Management** acknowledges significant "unallocated" buckets it cannot distribute
**Finance-Centric Platforms** rely on estimation models and static ratios rather than actual utilization
**Engineering Point Solutions** like Kubecost only solve Kubernetes, creating tool sprawl for hybrid environments

*The root cause: These solutions depend on flawed data sources (aggregated billing files) rather than ground-truth utilization metrics.*

### **CloudBolt's Architectural Advantage: The Agent as Your "Key"**

CloudBolt transforms opaque specialized compute costs into granular business intelligence through our revolutionary **FinOps Data Platform**:

**üîì Ground-Truth Data Collection**
- Agent-based architecture captures real-time metrics directly from within AVS and OpenShift environments
- Measures actual CPU, memory, and storage utilization at the VM, pod, and container level
- Goes beyond the bill to solve allocation at the source where API-only tools fail

**üí∞ Intelligent Cost Correlation**
- Applies true blended rates including Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, and Enterprise Agreements
- Distributes costs based on direct utilization metrics, not imprecise ratio-based estimates
- Transforms "unallocated" from a black hole into a quantified, manageable optimization target

**üéØ Business Context Preservation**
- Maps internal tags and labels to utilization data for meaningful attribution
- Enables allocation by team, application, project, or any business dimension
- Creates a single source of truth for both containerized (ROSA/ARO) and virtualized (AVS) environments

|                                  |                  | **Platform Unallocated**        | $77,600            |
