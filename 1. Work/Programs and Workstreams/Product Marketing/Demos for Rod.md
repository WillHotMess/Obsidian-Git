**[00:00:00 - Hook & Problem Statement]** "Trying to stay within your cloud budget is hard enough. And when every single _unlimited_ permutation is billed differently across clouds? **Good luck!** And even if you _do_ stay within budget at provisioning — try staying there! In this two-minute walkthrough, you're gonna see how easy it is to create budgets, provision cloud resources, and check anticipated costs without the usual budget blowouts."

**[00:00:20 - Differentiation & Governance]** "Here's the thing: unlike other approaches, simply having visibility isn't enough. To KEEP costs in line, you need to shift left and continuously prevent costly new services from being provisioned in the first place. That's the power of _governed_ provisioning — and it's exactly what CloudBolt delivers."

**[00:00:35 - Solution Overview]** "No more surprise bills. No more finger-pointing. Just intelligent guardrails that keep teams productive while protecting your bottom line through proactive governance."

**[00:00:45 - Feature Demo Begins]** "Let's start with budget creation. CloudBolt's grouping feature lets you define budgets at any level of your business – by department, project, environment, or any combination that makes sense. Cross-cloud budgets become effortless."

**[00:01:00 - Budget Dashboard]** "Once configured, you get instant visibility into forecasted spend versus budget. This budget is tracking perfectly on pace – but watch what happens when someone tries to provision resources..."

**[00:01:15 - Provisioning Experience]** "Here's where governed provisioning shines. Our intelligent blueprints don't just show technical specs – they show financial impact in real-time. Users see their monthly budget, current consumption, and exactly how their choices affect the bottom line."

**[00:01:30 - The Aha Moment]** "Oh sh#!t... didn't realize I'll be over budget! Notice what happens when I select this larger instance type: CloudBolt immediately warns that this choice would exceed our monthly budget by $212. This is prevention in action."

**[00:01:45 - Smart Guidance]** "No problem — choose a more efficient instance type. CloudBolt doesn't just say 'no' – it guides you to better choices. Moving to this smaller instance keeps us within budget while still meeting performance requirements."

**[00:02:00 - Resolution & Value]** "_Voila!_ Right-sized cloud resources that actually stay within budget. Imagine that! This is how you transform cloud financial management from reactive damage control to proactive, governed provisioning."
