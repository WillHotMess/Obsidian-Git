# Is Your FinOps Solution Ready for What's Next?

If you're managing cloud costs today, you already know the landscape has fundamentally changed. The 2025 State of FinOps report confirms what you're likely experiencing: 65% of organizations now manage SaaS spend through their FinOps practices, 49% are tackling licensing costs, and 63% are wrestling with AI investments spread across multiple environments. Yet look at your current toolset—is it still focused solely on public cloud IaaS with limited automation capabilities? 

**You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed.** Your peers report attempting to increase effort across 12 different capabilities while reducing effort in only 1-2. This explains why, despite your best efforts, 50% of organizations still cite workload optimization as their top priority year after year. The hard truth? Most traditional tools aren't helping you make meaningful progress. 

At CloudBolt our vision is to address these critical challenges once and for all.

# Comparison

### CloudBolt Summary:

CloudBolt offers an integrated cloud management and FinOps solution recognized as a Visionary in Gartner's Magic Quadrant, a Leader and Outperformer in GigaOm's Radar for Cloud FinOps, and a Strong Performer in Forrester's Wave. Our platform excels with its FOCUS-ready data platform providing true multi-cloud fabric visibility across public, private, and containerized environments, significantly enhanced by our recent StormForge acquisition for comprehensive Kubernetes optimization. Our Cloud Native Actions platform transforms manual FinOps processes into continuous, automated workflows, reducing insight-to-action lead time from weeks to minutes and enabling the 40-70% cost reductions our customers typically experience. CloudBolt maintains an open ecosystem approach through our Technology Alliance Program (TAP), enabling organizations to build their ideal FinOps toolkit rather than forcing them into rigid platforms. GigaOm specifically highlights our "superior bidirectional integration" capabilities and strength in hybrid cloud management, while Forrester notes our excellence in "access and permissions, usage policies, and capacity planning." With flexible pricing not tied to cloud spend percentage, CloudBolt delivers both immediate cost savings and long-term FinOps maturity across finance, IT, and engineering teams.

### IBM Cloudability Summary:

IBM Cloudability, acquired through IBM's $4.6 billion purchase of Apptio in 2023, is positioned as a Leader in both Gartner's Magic Quadrant and Forrester's Wave for cloud financial management. The platform excels in high-level cost analytics, budgeting, and forecasting capabilities particularly suited for finance teams in large enterprises. Cloudability offers Business Mappings for cost allocation and container cost visibility, though it receives criticism for its complexity, steep learning curve, and dated user interface that limits broader adoption. A key strategic focus is the ongoing integration with IBM's Turbonomic platform to combine Cloudability's financial visibility with Turbonomic's robust automation capabilities, though this integration remains incomplete. The platform uses a percentage-of-spend pricing model with mandatory consulting services across all tiers, making it primarily suited for organizations with substantial budgets. While strong in high-level reporting for finance teams, users report limitations in more granular, engineering-focused insights, data timeliness, and poor API documentation for custom integration. IBM's vision includes leveraging Apptio's repository of $450 billion in anonymized IT spend data to fuel watsonx AI initiatives, potentially leading to new predictive capabilities.

### When to Choose CloudBolt:

- You need an intuitive platform with faster time-to-value and lower learning curve
- Your organization requires automated remediation actions, not just recommendations
- You want transparent, predictable pricing rather than a percentage-of-spend model
- You need to engage engineers in FinOps with user-friendly interfaces

- You need comprehensive Kubernetes cost management with ML-powered optimization
- You require balanced multi-cloud parity across AWS, Azure, and GCP
- You want a modern platform with a focus on continuous innovation and automation
- Your hybrid environment includes private cloud that requires cost visibility

### When to Choose IBM Cloudability:

- You're a large enterprise with a substantial cloud budget and dedicated FinOps team
- You primarily need sophisticated financial reporting and forecasting capabilities
- Your finance team is the main stakeholder for cloud cost management
- You value IBM's broader technology ecosystem and potential AI integration
- You're willing to invest in consulting services and training for implementation
