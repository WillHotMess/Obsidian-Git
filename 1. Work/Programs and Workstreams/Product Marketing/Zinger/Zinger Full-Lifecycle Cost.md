Anyone managing hybrid cloud knows that private cloud costs are all but missing in most FinOps programs. VMware, OpenShift, Nutanix — they're running critical workloads but completely invisible in most cloud management tools. Sound familiar? This creates massive blind spots where a high percentage of your infrastructure has zero financial accountability.

Here's the thing: most tools make you manually calculate private cloud costs _after_ resources are already deployed and budgets are blown. That's reactive spreadsheet chaos. But what if you could prevent cost overruns before they happen? What if private cloud had the same real-time cost visibility and governance as public cloud?

Today, we're gonna show how CloudBolt transforms private cloud from a cost mystery into a fully governed, chargeback-enabled environment. In three minutes, you'll see automated rate cards, real-time cost previews, and prevention policies that guide users to smart choices — automatically.

Using our CloudBolt Agent, we've connected directly to VMware, OpenShift, and other on-prem environments. But we don't just collect data — watch what happens when we configure intelligent rate logic...

We're setting custom rates that mirror your actual costs. Global defaults for CPU, memory, and storage. But here's the smart part: OS-specific rates that automatically factor in licensing. Windows costs more than Linux? The platform knows and prevents surprises.

Watch this prevention in action. A developer needs a new server and starts provisioning. Instead of deploying blind, they see _exactly_ what it'll cost — in real-time. VMware shows $XX/month, AWS shows $XX/month, Azure shows $XX/month.

But it gets smarter... When they select Windows over Linux, boom — the licensing cost appears instantly. $XX extra per month. No surprise invoices, no budget shock. They're making informed decisions _before_ deployment.

Now for some cost steering, we can set tiered rates that escalate costs for larger instances. Need a massive VM? The higher rate kicks in automatically, making users think twice.

Now on to automated chargeback. Every resource deployed gets tagged with cost center, application, and owner. Our cost reports show VMware costs right alongside AWS and Azure. One view, total cost transparency.

Look at this: filter by any dimension — cost center, application, environment — and see your complete hybrid spend. No more "public cloud is $X and private cloud is... uh... we'll get back to you."

_Voila!_ You've just transformed private cloud from a financial black hole into a fully managed, cost-optimized environment. Your finance team gets accurate chargeback, your developers make smarter choices, and you prevent millions in wasteful spending — all automatically.

This is how you shift from reactive cost reporting to proactive cost prevention. Ready to shine a light on your private cloud costs and maximize your hybrid cloud ROI? See how CloudBolt prevents cost chaos before it happens.
