# The Cloud FinOps Platform for Resale & Distribution

## Purpose-built for cloud resellers & distributors to automate billing, protect margins, and back high-value FinOps services.

### Are manual processes and revenue leakage eroding your cloud margins?

Every month is a painful cycle. Your team spends weeks buried in spreadsheets and homegrown scripts, wrestling with complex provider bills, manually applying pricing rules, and hunting for errors. Each delay pushes out cash flow and damages the customer experience you work so hard to build.

Meanwhile, financial strain is constant. Inaccuracy leads to revenue leakage, operational overhead eats into already small profits, and customers are starting to demand the modern cost analytics your current tools can't provide. This creates a "Trust Gap" between the data you show them mid-month and the final bill they receive, eroding your reputation as a cloud expert.

### The tools that got you to now, won't scale

The reality is that your competitive alternative isn't another software vendor—it's the fragile, human-driven process you rely on today. Whether it's a complex web of Excel files or a legacy billing tool that’s failing to deliver on its promises, these systems create constant bottlenecks and prevent you from scaling.

You're stuck in one of three scenarios:
- Your process is **too human-driven:** Manual data entry and reconciliation are consuming your most skilled resources.
- Your current tool is **inaccurate:** An incumbent platform is making frequent billing errors, destroying customer trust and requiring costly manual oversight.
- You're **falling behind on modern services:** You know you need to offer value-added FinOps, but your current billing engine lacks the capabilities.
