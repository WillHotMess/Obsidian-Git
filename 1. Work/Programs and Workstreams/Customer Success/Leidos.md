### **CloudBolt Perspective:**

**The Pain We See Across Federal & Enterprise:**

- **Financial Pain:** "Operational costs are too high" - agencies spending millions on failed automation attempts
- **People Pain:** "Not enough resources to handle request workload" - manual processes requiring weeks and multiple teams
- **Productivity Pain:** "Slow build times or missed SLAs" - provisioning taking days/weeks instead of minutes
- **Process Pain:** "Siloed processes that lack cohesion" - each team managing separate instances with no unified control

**What Customers Need:**
- Transform from **days-to-weeks provisioning → 15-minute automated delivery**
- Enable **90% reduction in manual work** while scaling 5x (proven results)
- **Unified control plane** without replacing existing tools (ServiceNow, Terraform, Ansible)

### **Leidos Perspective:**

**Federal Market Reality:**
- Agencies demanding **"do more with less"** under DOGE efficiency mandates
- Need **repeatable offerings** that can deploy across Navy, CMS, HHS, FAA quickly
- Current Morpheus investment showing **"nothing to show for it"** - need proven alternatives
- **FY2026 sustainment** already requested - solutions needed NOW, not in 2-3 years

**Partnership Opportunity:**
- Focus on **expanding from commercial enterprise into federal** with Leidos's help
- Leidos brings **federal market access** CloudBolt needs for growth
- **Second Front partnership** can expedite FedRAMP for broader federal adoption

### **The Gap to Fill:**

Federal agencies need **automated cloud management yesterday**, not custom builds taking years. Leidos needs **differentiated, repeatable solutions** to win contracts. CloudBolt provides the **proven platform** ready for immediate federal deployment.

### **Proven Implementation Success:**
- **Reduced provisioning from 4-6 hours → 15 minutes**
- **Scaled from 100 → 500+ servers without adding headcount
- **Tens of thousands of jobs run per day with 99% success rate**

## **Market Context & Macro Pressures**

**Federal Efficiency Mandates:**

- **DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency)** driving unprecedented pressure to reduce costs and demonstrate operational efficiency
- Agencies required to "do more with less" while maintaining mission readiness
- Manual processes taking weeks/months no longer acceptable under new efficiency standards

**Vendor Disruption Creating Opportunity:**

- **Broadcom acquisition** causing federal agencies to rethink VMware strategies
- **Morpheus acquisition by HPE** leaving customers uncertain about platform future
- Federal customers actively seeking proven alternatives to avoid vendor lock-in

**Cloud Strategy Evolution:**

- **Public cloud cost inefficiency** driving workload repatriation back to private/hybrid environments
- Agencies rethinking the "pie chart" of where workloads should reside
- Need for unified management across increasingly complex hybrid environments

**Modernization Imperative:**

- Federal modernization initiatives require new operational models
- Legacy approaches (manual provisioning, siloed tools) incompatible with modern mission requirements
- **Government bureaucracy reality:** Without automation, simple deployments still take weeks for approvals + ATO + implementation

**Why This Matters NOW:** These macro forces create a perfect storm where agencies MUST transform their cloud operations immediately - not in 2-3 years. Leidos + CloudBolt can deliver pre-built, ATO-ready templates that cut deployment time from weeks to minutes, directly addressing these pressures.

**Federal FinOps Has Moved From Pilot to Policy**
Cloud adoption without cost accountability is over—major agencies now mandate enterprise-wide FinOps strategies, FOCUS-compliant reporting, and automated optimization.

- **GSA establishing federal standard:** 5-agency pilot driving FOCUS compliance and best practices across VA, DOE, NRC, Army, OPM
- **DoD enterprise mandate (Sept 2024):** Department-wide Cloud FinOps Strategy requires unified cost reporting, KPIs, and FinOps integration into governance across all services
- **Proven ROI precedent:** Army ECMA's financial management platform delivered $11M+ savings—validating federal willingness to adopt third-party tools with measurable returns
