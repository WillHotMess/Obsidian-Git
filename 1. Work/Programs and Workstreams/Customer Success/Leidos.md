### **CloudBolt Perspective:**

**The Pain We See Across Federal & Enterprise:**

- **Financial Pain:** "Operational costs are too high" - agencies spending millions on failed automation attempts
- **People Pain:** "Not enough resources to handle request workload" - manual processes requiring weeks and multiple teams
- **Productivity Pain:** "Slow build times or missed SLAs" - provisioning taking days/weeks instead of minutes
- **Process Pain:** "Siloed processes that lack cohesion" - each team managing separate instances with no unified control

**What Customers Need:**
- Transform from **days-to-weeks provisioning → 15-minute automated delivery**
- Enable **90% reduction in manual work** while scaling 5x (proven results)
- **Unified control plane** without replacing existing tools (ServiceNow, Terraform, Ansible)

### **Leidos Perspective:**

**Federal Market Reality:**
- Agencies demanding **"do more with less"** under DOGE efficiency mandates
- Need **repeatable offerings** that can deploy across Navy, CMS, HHS, FAA quickly
- Current Morpheus investment showing **"nothing to show for it"** - need proven alternatives
- **FY2026 sustainment** already requested - solutions needed NOW, not in 2-3 years

**Partnership Opportunity:**
- Focus on **expanding from commercial enterprise into federal** with Leidos's help
- Leidos brings **federal market access** CloudBolt needs for growth
- **Second Front partnership** can expedite FedRAMP for broader federal adoption

### **The Gap to Fill:**

Federal agencies need **automated cloud management yesterday**, not custom builds taking years. Leidos needs **differentiated, repeatable solutions** to win contracts. CloudBolt provides the **proven platform** ready for immediate federal deployment.
