### Common Requests and Questions

Across the calls, prospects consistently ask about the platform's fundamental ability to handle the complexity of their multi-tenant business model.

- **Multi-Tenancy and Segmentation:** The most frequent questions revolve around managing a diverse customer base. They ask:
    - "Can we control features and data access for different types of customers (e.g., resale-only vs. full managed service)?"
    - "How can we see recommendations and savings opportunities aggregated for all our clients in one place, but also grouped by each specific customer?"
    - "Can we create custom groups of accounts based on our own logic for filtering and reporting?"
        
- **Data Ingestion and Accuracy:** Prospects are highly concerned with the initial setup and the integrity of the data. They ask:
    - "How do you connect directly to our Azure CSP Partner Center or AWS consolidated billing account?"
    - "How do you ensure the cost data in your tool perfectly matches the final invoice we send to the customer?"
    - "Can your platform handle multiple CSP tenants or payer accounts from our company acquisitions?"
        
- **Billing Logic and Financial Control:** They want to know if the tool can handle their specific financial models. They ask:
    - "Can we implement dynamic markups or margins on a per-customer or even per-subscription basis?"
    - "How do we show a client their _actual_ cost after our shared Reserved Instances or Savings Plans are applied?"
        
- **Integration and Automation:** They need the platform to fit into their existing ecosystem. They ask:
    - "Can you integrate with our ITSM tools like ServiceNow or JIRA for task management and approvals?"
    - "What are your API capabilities for connecting with our internal finance systems?"

### Typical Pains and Core Needs

The prospects' pains reveal a clear need for a solution that solves deep operational and strategic challenges.

- **Pain: Manual Processes & Operational Inefficiency.**
    - **Description:** They are buried in manual work, using a combination of homegrown tools, Excel, and Power BI to reconcile bills and create reports. This is described as "horrendous," "not an effective way to deliver," and extremely time-consuming.
    - **Need:** **Automation.** They need a platform to automate the entire billing and reconciliation process, from data ingestion to invoicing, to free up expensive consultant time and reduce long billing cycles.
        
- **Pain: Outdated and Inadequate Tooling.**
    - **Description:** Their current tools, whether internal or from a competitor (like CloudHealth), are "falling behind." They lack critical, modern features like native cost anomaly detection, automated budgeting, and sophisticated RI/SP optimization.
    - **Need:** **A Modern, All-in-One FinOps Platform.** They need a single solution that provides a full suite of FinOps capabilities without requiring them to stitch together multiple tools.
        
- **Pain: Inaccurate Data and a Lack of Trust.**
    - **Description:** A recurring and critical pain is that the "numbers never lined up" between their existing tools and the final customer invoice. This frustrates customers and damages the MSP's credibility.
    - **Need:** **A Single Source of Truth.** They need a platform where the daily cost analysis data is the same as the billing data, ensuring accuracy and eliminating disputes.
        
- **Pain: Inability to Launch and Scale Value-Added Services.**
    - **Description:** Many prospects are actively trying to "relaunch their Azure managed services" or "build a FinOps service" to stay competitive, but their current tools are a roadblock.
    - **Need:** **A Service Enablement Platform.** They need a tool that not only manages their internal billing but also serves as the engine for delivering high-margin FinOps advisory services to their clients.
        
- **Pain: Poor Visibility for Both Internal Teams and End-Customers.**
    - **Description:** They struggle to get a holistic view across all their clients and cannot easily drill down into cost spikes ("cost forensics"). At the same time, they cannot provide their customers with the self-service visibility they demand.
    - **Need:** **A True Multi-Tenant Reporting & Analytics Engine.** They need a solution that is fundamentally "MSP friendly," allowing them to see all client data in one place while also providing customized, white-labeled views for each end-customer.
