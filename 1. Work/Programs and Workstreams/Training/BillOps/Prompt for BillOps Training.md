Here are a couple nuances we should add:

1. Providers have a few - intertwined - pain points they are looking to solve:
	1. The first is internal billing. They need to segment out customers, with their specific logic, and have final bill reconciliation automated quickly and sent to their overarching billing platform/tool (QuickBooks, or something similar). So that cloud purchases show up as a line item (against other items such as services costs, marketplace purchases, or other.) 
	2. The second is that their customers (and the internal customer account teams) need to be able to explore/analyze their costs - versus getting just the final bill at the end of the month.  
	3. Finally, many service providers are looking to offer FinOps-type services to their customers (either as a value add for procuring through them, or as a paid add-on, or both)
		1. For 2 & 3, it is critical that the platform used matches the final bill (which is a differentiation of using CloudBolt)
			1. Imagine if a customer is tracking their costs directly in Azure Cost Manager - or - using a competitor (such as Cloudability) that does not layer in their particular financial agreement/logic. The delta between what is shown throughout the billing period and the final bill would be extreme.

# We are working on a Cloud Reselling and Distribution enablement session for our field. Here is the three part series: 
<
**Block 1: Today's Session - The Foundation**

- **What:** Market Mechanics 101

- **Focus:** Who are the players (CSPs, MSPs, Distributors)? How do the Direct vs. Indirect models work? How does the money flow? Why are margins so thin?

- **Goal:** Establish a baseline understanding of the ecosystem.

**Block 2: Our Next Session - The 'Why'**

- **What:** Uncovering the Pain & Positioning Our Solution

- **Focus:** Deep dive into reseller pain points (inaccuracy, manual effort, scale). Map specific platform capabilities to solve those pains. Learn the key discovery questions.

- **Goal:** Connect the market mechanics to customer pain and our solution's value.

**Block 3: Future Sessions - The Execution**

- **What:** Winning the Deal

- **Focus:** Advanced discovery, competitive battlecards, handling objections, and building a business case with the customer. We will listen to real customer calls (like Giacom & Transparency) to hear the pain in their own words.

- **Goal:** Equip you to manage the sales cycle from start to finish.

# Last time, we worked on block one and teased block two. Today, we are going through block two, where we focus on uncovering the pain, and digging deeper into the solution. 

Here we will focus on personas, discovery questions, and how our product solves these solutions. 

# I am going to provide you with the following assets: 
- A transcript of block one enablement
- A solution guide of our product 
- Website copy
- A list of BANT discovery questions
- Insight from real customer calls
