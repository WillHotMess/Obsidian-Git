Here are a couple nuances we should add:

1. Providers have a few - intertwined - pain points they are looking to solve:
	1. The first is internal billing. They need to segment out customers, with their specific logic, and have final bill reconciliation automated quickly and sent to their overarching billing platform/tool (QuickBooks, or something similar). So that cloud purchases show up as a line item (against other items such as services costs, marketplace purchases, or other.) 
	2. The second is that their customers (and the internal customer account teams) need to be able to explore/analyze their costs - versus getting just the final bill at the end of the month.  
	3. Finally, many service providers are looking to offer FinOps-type services to their customers (either as a value add for procuring through them, or as a paid add-on, or both)
		1. For 2 & 3, it is critical that the platform used matches the final bill (which is a differentiation of using CloudBolt)
			1. Imagine if a customer is tracking their costs directly in Azure Cost Manager - or - using a competitor (such as Cloudability) that does not layer in their particular financial agreement/logic. The delta between what is shown throughout the billing period and the final bill would be extreme.
