    
**Strategic Shift Proposed by You:** Move from a simple list of events to a **stratified "big bet" topology**. This framework provides a more balanced and resilient demand-gen portfolio.
    
- **Next Steps:**
    - You will send Colton the previous plan that **Irwin** had developed
    - Colton's immediate next step is to discuss partner programs (like Partner Casts) with **Sapto**, the AWS SA.
    - Colton will redraft his plan using the "big bet" topology discussed.
    - You and Colton will connect **early next week** to review his first draft.
    - You suggested a separate, focused meeting on event strategy with you, Colton, **Josh**, and **Yasmin**.

### ## Estimated 2026 AWS Demand Gen Topology

Example framework you outlined for Colton. It starts with the main financial goal and breaks it down into major investment pillars, each with specific strategies and tactics.

#### **Overall Goal: Generate $4M in Top-Line Pipeline**
- _Operating Assumption: 50% conversion from Stage 1 to Stage 4 pipeline._

---

#### **Pillar 1: Events**

(Example Contribution: ~25% of pipeline)

This pillar contains all virtual and in-person event activities. The focus should shift to targeting higher-level personas and ensuring a clear, trackable CTA.

- **In-Person Events**
    - **Conferences:** Sponsoring major industry events (e.g., KubeCon, AWS Summits in major metros, AWS FinTech Exchange).
    - **Hosted Events:** Creating our own curated events for specific personas (e.g., SRE leaders, FinOps leaders).
        
- **Virtual Events**
    - **Partner "PartnerCasts":** Leveraging AWS's platform to reach their audience.
    - **Thought Leadership Webinars:** Focused on business outcomes, not just practitioners.
    - **Co-hosted Webinars:** Partnering with channel partners like Ingram or with customers for case studies.

---

#### **Pillar 2: Co-Selling with AWS**

(Example Contribution: ~45% of pipeline)

This pillar focuses on direct field alignment and creating joint selling motions with the AWS sales teams. It likely represents the largest potential pipeline source.

- **Territory & Account Mapping:** Aligning our sales reps with AWS reps in key territories, starting with Kubernetes specialists for StormForge.
- **"Wake the Dead" Campaign:** A joint effort to re-engage past StormForge leads and opportunities where AWS can help open doors.
- **Defined Co-Sell "Plays":**
    - **Migration Acceleration Play:** Targeting customers moving on-prem Kubernetes workloads to AWS (EKS). The value proposition is right-sizing the environment _before_ migration to reduce cloud costs.
    - **Modernization Play:** Focusing on application modernization initiatives.
    - **Company Sales Plays:** Aligning with broader GTM motions like the "Broadcom Takeout" or FinOps initiatives.

---

#### **Pillar 3: AWS Marketplace Expansion**

(Example Contribution: ~30% of pipeline)

This pillar is about optimizing and expanding our presence on the AWS Marketplace, which you noted is a major untapped opportunity.

- **SKU Expansion:** Creating a better motion to sell **non-StormForge products** (like the core CMP platform) through the marketplace.
- **Program Utilization:** Researching and leveraging marketplace programs we are currently not using to drive demand.
- **Marketplace-Specific Campaigns:** Running promotions or campaigns exclusively for marketplace transactions.
