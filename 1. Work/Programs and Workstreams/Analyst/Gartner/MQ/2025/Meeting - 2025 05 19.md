## Summary

The meeting focused on planning the approach for creating a series of video demonstrations and briefings for a Gartner assessment. The discussion covered strategy for producing eleven question-focused videos and seven use case videos, with emphasis on highlighting CloudBolt's strengths and differentiators. Key recommendations included focusing on evidence rather than "how-to" demonstrations, creating a consistent narrative that reinforces the company's "golden threads," incorporating real customer examples, and ensuring the format effectively communicates both the "what" and the "so what" of each capability.

## Agenda

- Discuss approach for creating video demonstrations for Gartner assessment
- Review strategy for briefing presentations
- Determine customer examples to highlight
- Plan production workflow

## Discussion Notes

- **Video Demonstration Approach**:
    
    - Jeff emphasized that demonstrations should focus on showing evidence of functionality rather than providing how-to training sessions. The format should highlight why CloudBolt is a leader and showcase the strength of their capabilities.
    - The demos should present navigation, reports, and drilling capabilities while explaining why they're special or complete. This differs from sales presentations which are more "how-to" oriented.
    - Instead of just showing features ("the what"), the demos need to communicate "the so what" - explaining why capabilities are different or important to make the presentation more convincing.
- **Video Structure and Format**:
    
    - Each section should be approximately 5 minutes long
    - Jeff recommended beginning with a 90-second "scene zero" or establishing shot that introduces the product, shows the main screen, and highlights design principles and common navigation elements to demonstrate the integrated platform approach
    - The recommendation is to create one continuous 55-minute video with chapter headers rather than separate files, as the portal has a limitation of only accepting 10 files
    - This approach supports two modes of consumption: watching end-to-end and returning to review specific sections of interest
- **Production Process**:
    
    - The team should create a storyboard first, planning out content before recording to avoid having to re-record segments
    - It was recommended to record one section first as a test before recording the rest
    - Production quality isn't being graded, but videos should be tight with minimal dead air and unnecessary elements
    - Simple editing like removing long load times is appropriate, but fancy transitions aren't necessary
    - Jeff cautioned about "dead video" - staying on the same screen for too long without visual changes can become boring
- **Use Case Videos**:
    
    - Each use case has a 10-minute time limit and should be kept within that bracket
    - Mark emphasized the importance of using all the allocated time effectively
    - Roadmap can be discussed for areas where offerings are currently thin
    - Jeff recommended a structure consisting of: summary thesis statement, differentiation points, storytelling with examples, and a bottom-line conclusion
- **Customer References**:
    
    - Named customer references get more weight than generic examples
    - Gartner won't call the customers or include them in the report; these are examples, not endorsements. Names won't be shared in inquiries with other prospects or vendors
    - The only customers that shouldn't be named are those with contractual prohibitions against it
    - Mark noted that contract language regarding customer references has become tighter recently
- **Content Strategy**:
    
    - For use cases, Jeff suggested a ratio of about 3/4 slides and talking points with 1/4 product demonstration
    - Kyle mentioned several customers that could be highlighted across the different use cases, including Suncorp, Alston, JISC, Readapt, Acquia, and U.S. Bank
    - Jeff noted it's okay to reuse customer examples, but overusing the same ones can make the company appear small or limited
    - The team discussed introducing "golden threads" - overarching value propositions and philosophical approaches that could be consistently reinforced across all videos

## Action Items

- [ ] Create storyboards for all video segments before recording begins
- [ ] Schedule meeting between Jeff, Peter, and Will to discuss demo approach and style
- [ ] Kyle to finalize customer examples for each use case, aiming for unique examples where possible
- [ ] Mark to start drafting responses to his assigned questions and share works-in-progress with Jeff for review
- [ ] Team to produce one test video section before proceeding with full production
- [ ] Team to create one continuous 55-minute video with chapter markers rather than separate files

## Follow-up

- Next meeting date: To be scheduled as needed for checkpoints and reviews
