Dear CFMT Government MQ team,

Thank you for the opportunity to review your draft research for the MQ and CC for Cloud Financial Management Tools.

We appreciate your recognition of our presence, position and investment in this market and its evolution. We have several factual corrections for each of the documents provided for review. We walk through each of them below.

MQ document

In the second summary paragraph you say “CloudBolt’s solution is priced per user[[JC1]](#_msocom_1) ”

·        This is factually incorrect as Cloudbolt employs several different pricing metrics to maximize transparency and a fair representation of value.

·        <<drop in your supporting stats info>>

·        Suggested rewording “CloudBolt’s solution is primarily priced per user with alternative metrics for some functions”

<<insert other opening par examples here is needed>>

In caution 2 you say “CloudBolt trails some of the other vendors in lacking out of the box commitment management capabilities. It supports this through a third party”

·        This is factually incorrect as our commitment management is provided out-of-the box through the OEM embedding Archera. The integration has no licensing impact on our end customers and separate implementation requirements. It is transparently embedded with contractual provisions that our customers are protected.

·        The functionality is transparently provided to users and it sources should not detract from full marks for our functionality. OEM product inclusion to achieve best-of-class capability is a common industry practice and can often yield better end results that home-development of a less capable solution. We believe Gartner’s singling out of sourcing is an exaggeration of perceived risk and an inflammatory underscoring of capabilities.

Suggest rewording, “CloudBolt’s commitment management capabilities are delivered the through OEM embedding of Archera. Prospective customers should inspect the suitability for their situation.”

Despite you statement in the strength that “●    Functionality delivery: CloudBolt continues to have an ambitious vision that aligns to where the CFM market is heading with many planned product enhancements. Prospective customers,” out vision scoring seems low (overly leftward in the visionary quadrant.” We believe the delivered innovation, delivery on our roadmap and strength of plans and ability to invest merit a second look. We respectfully request that the factors be reconsidered, particularly Market Understanding, Product Strategy and Innovation.

CC document

<<repeat structure>>

<<call out scores that are too low based on the evidence submitted in the RFI and demo. Cite specific questions and demo time code>>

<<Where appropriate, suggest a revised score??

Based on the scoring discrepancies, we request not only a revision of CC document text, but of the CC scores (and implicitly use case scores and graphs) for  <<name the impacted CC>>

Again, thank you for the opportunity to review your draft research. Please let us know if these changes are acceptable or if they need further discussion. We are happy to arrange a call or provide additional information.

Regards,

<<Cloudbolt signer>>
