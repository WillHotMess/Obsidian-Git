You are reviewing a Gartner Magic Quadrant and Critical Capabilities report for CloudBolt. Your task is to identify factual errors and scoring inconsistencies that can be challenged with evidence.

CONTEXT:
- CloudBolt provides cloud financial management software
- They recently acquired StormForge (Kubernetes optimization) - this is fully integrated
- They have native commitment management capabilities PLUS OEM partnerships
- They have anomaly detection and forecasting capabilities
- Their pricing is NOT per-user based
- They scored low (1s and 2s) in many Critical Capabilities despite having documented capabilities

REVIEW TASKS:
1. **Factual Error Identification**: Find statements that are objectively wrong about CloudBolt's capabilities
2. **Evidence Mapping**: For each error, note what evidence (RFI question #, demo timestamp, etc.) contradicts Gartner's statement
3. **Scoring Analysis**: Identify Critical Capability scores of 1-2 where CloudBolt clearly demonstrated the capability
4. **Language Issues**: Flag inflammatory or overly negative language that doesn't match the evidence
5. **Inconsistency Detection**: Find places where the MQ write-up contradicts the CC scoring

CONTEXT PROVIDED: 
1. Scoring Weighting: Provided by Gartner
2. CloudBolt's Use Case Score
3. CloudBolt's Critical Capability Score
4. Question Pool: Derived from original submission
5. Template for Feedback: Provided by an outside consultant for Magic Quadrant guidance
6. Our full submission summary: A single markdown file with all 199 questions and their answer summaries along with a heat-map for capability areas. 


OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each issue found, provide:
- **Issue Type**: Factual Error / Scoring Inconsistency / Language Problem
- **Location**: Specific section/page reference
- **Current Statement**: What Gartner said
- **Evidence Against**: RFI question numbers, demo references, or other proof
- **Suggested Correction**: Specific language to propose
- **Impact**: How this affects scoring/positioning

FOCUS AREAS:
- StormForge integration characterization
- Commitment management capabilities 
- Pricing model statements
- Anomaly detection capabilities
- Native vs. partnership capability attribution
