## Revised AI Review Prompt

```
You are preparing a formal response to Gartner's Magic Quadrant and Critical Capabilities draft for CloudBolt. Follow this EXACT structure for each issue identified:

RESPONSE STRUCTURE (for each factual error):

**In [LOCATION] you say "[EXACT GARTNER QUOTE]"**
- This is factually incorrect because [SPECIFIC REASON]
- [EVIDENCE]: In RFI question [#], we stated [X]. In demo minute [timestamp], we demonstrated [Y]
- [ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING EVIDENCE if available]
- Suggested rewording: "[PROPOSED REPLACEMENT TEXT]"

CONTEXT FOR REVIEW:
- CloudBolt has fully integrated StormForge (not external partnership)
- Native commitment management capabilities PLUS Archera OEM integration
- Pricing is NOT per-user based
- Has demonstrated anomaly detection and forecasting capabilities
- Strong Kubernetes optimization through StormForge acquisition
- Anything we predominantly answered "Yes" to in the questionaire, but EITHER received low marks in the final scoring OR were ngatievely reviewed in the write-up(s)

CRITICAL FOCUS AREAS:
1. **Pricing Model Misstatements** - Any reference to "per user" pricing
2. **StormForge Integration** - Characterized as separate product vs. fully integrated
3. **Commitment Management** - Understated native capabilities due to partnership perception
4. **Technical Capabilities** - Low CC scores (1-2) where clear evidence exists

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Quote Gartner's exact language
- Provide specific RFI question numbers and demo timestamps as evidence
- Suggest precise rewording that's fair but corrects the error
- Focus on factual errors, not subjective assessments
- Prioritize issues that impact scoring/positioning
```

    - [ ] Map each low score to RFI question evidence
    - [ ] Include demo timestamps where capabilities were shown
    - [ ] Suggest revised scores (e.g., "request rescoring to 2.7" vs. current 1.8)
- [ ] **Systematic Scoring Request**
    - [ ] Identify which Critical Capabilities need score revision
    - [ ] Request both text and numerical score changes
    - [ ] Note impact on use case scores and graphs

### **Closing Template**

```
Based on the scoring discrepancies, we request not only a revision of CC document text, but of the CC scores (and implicitly use case scores and graphs) for [LIST SPECIFIC CRITICAL CAPABILITIES]

Again, thank you for the opportunity to review your draft research. Please let us know if these changes are acceptable or if they need further discussion. We are happy to arrange a call or provide additional information.

## Strategic Approach Refinements

### **Evidence Standards**
- Every factual challenge MUST include specific RFI question numbers
- Demo timestamps required for capability demonstrations
- Use exact Gartner quotes, not paraphrases
- Propose specific replacement language, not just complaints

### **Tone Guidelines**
- Professional and respectful
- Evidence-based, not argumentative
- Focus on "factually incorrect" language
- Acknowledge Gartner's expertise while correcting errors

### **Prioritization**
1. **High Impact**: Pricing model, StormForge characterization, Commitment management
2. **Scoring Issues**: CC scores of 1-2 where clear evidence exists
3. **Positioning**: Vision quadrant placement based on strengths/cautions inconsistency

### **Success Metrics**
- Correction of persistent factual errors
- CC score improvements from 1s to 2.7+ where justified
- Rightward movement in vision quadrant
- Foundation for improved future evaluations

This approach transforms the consultant's guidance into a structured, evidence-based response that follows Gartner's preferred format while maximizing CloudBolt's positioning improvement opportunities.
