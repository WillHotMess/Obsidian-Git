Quick reads / strong opinions:

- Use the **unified experience** + **FOCUS-native** quotes to dismantle “multiple tools/separate product” and “reporting trails” claims in one shot.
    
- Pair **commitment allocation** + RFI Q28 to push back on “third‑party only” commitment narrative; then note OEM Archera enhances (doesn’t replace) native.
    
- Lean on **AI/ML anomalies** and **schedule-aware planning** to challenge “limited anomaly detection” and “lack scheduling” language.
    
- For forecasting, the transcript explicitly says **“long stretches of time”** and **multi‑granularity**—that’s not “static 90 days.”
    

If you want, I can now drop these directly into the formal “In [LOCATION] you say…” template with the exact MQ/CC quotes you shared and the RFI question IDs already slotted.
