## Financial Risk Management

**Proactive Anomaly Detection and Incident Response**  
We are advancing our anomaly detection capabilities to automatically identify, categorize, and escalate unauthorized or unexpected cloud costs in real time, enabling rapid troubleshooting and targeted remediation to mitigate budget overruns and financial risk.

**Automated Root Cause Analysis and Remediation**  
Our roadmap includes automated workflows that not only detect cost anomalies but also perform root cause analysis, suggest corrective actions, and trigger remediation through integrated ITSM tools, reducing manual intervention and accelerating resolution.

**Continuous Policy-Driven Governance**  
We are developing dynamic policy frameworks that enforce spend controls, budget thresholds, and approval workflows across business units, ensuring ongoing compliance and minimizing the risk of unapproved expenditures.

## Forecasting and Estimation

**AI-Driven Predictive Forecasting**  
We are investing in advanced machine learning models that leverage historical usage, seasonality, and business context to deliver highly accurate, application-level cloud spend forecasts, supporting proactive budget management and scenario planning.

**Workload Cost Modeling and Simulation**  
Our roadmap features enhanced workload modeling tools that allow teams to simulate architectural changes and new deployments, providing real-time cost estimates to inform design decisions and contract negotiations before resources are provisioned.

**Integrated Budget Planning and Variance Analysis**  
We are building unified budget planning modules that align forecasts with business objectives, track spending against plan, and provide automated variance analysis to help customers optimize resource allocation and avoid surprises.
