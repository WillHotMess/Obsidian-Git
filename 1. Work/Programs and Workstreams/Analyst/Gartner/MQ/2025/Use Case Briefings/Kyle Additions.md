Focusing now on all sections, we need to rewrite the key differentiation and investment themes (only - do not rewrite everything). Using the notes provided by my Chief Product Officer, provide me with refactored diff and invest sections for all use-cases: 

# Financial Risk Management | Driving Cost Efficiency | Maximizing Business Value _(hard to separate)_We have invested heavily in this area as this is simultaneously one of the weakest areas of maturity in the vendor ecosystem and the greatest area of user need. Our investment is in these primary areas:  

- **Continuous Optimization**: Shifting the paradigm from simply _reporting_ on financial risk, to reporting _and_ acting to derisk by resolving the financial waste. We bring attention to this through metrics like FinOps Performance Index, Optimization Score and Insight to Action Lead Time. We then improve those metrics by giving users the agency to tune waste signals in their business context and then create automated workflows that remediate that waste. This reduces the exposure time of financial risk driving cloud ROI higher.
- **Kubernetes Advanced Optimization(AI/ML)**: Bringing continuous optimization to Kubernetes meant investing into AI/ML classifiers that can intelligently deliver a stream of rightsizing recommendations based on realtime usage patterns and safe deployment of those recommendations to drive improved resilience and cost efficiency in Kubernetes clusters.
- **Visibility and Optimization Expansion into SaaS**: Our integration of SaaS Optimization gives our customers an expansive view into their total spend and efficiency, with benchmarking, license management and contract renewal capabilities we have removed the chaos and illuminated prior blind spots to give our customers greater agency over their business value.

Going forward:  

- **Invoice Enforcer**: Recent industry insights show upwards of 30-40% of cloud service provider invoice line items contain inaccuracies against contracted cost. This represents a massive amount of risk and waste at large enterprise scale. We are building an enforcement pipeline that will catch these invoicing errors and allow customers to receive billing credits. This also has value for Service Providers to validate both upstream and downstream invoices to their own customers to make sure all invoice line items align with custom contracted rates.

- **Derived Unit Cost**: (Business Value) Building on the custom metrics support we will be able to correlate related cost drivers against a value metric and derive unit cost trends and tie into anomaly alerting and our KPIs that feed FinOps Performance Index.

# Forecasting and Estimation

- **Forecasting Models(AI/ML)**: We have invested in ML models that examine rolling 90day windows of all cloud spend data at multiple levels of rollup(Cloud Provider, Account level etc..) to provide a daily re-forecast of cloud spend that accounts for seasonality and outliers. This is integrated into our cost dashboards to give easy and accurate visibility into forward looking trend.

Going forward:  

- **“What if” Scenario Analysis**: Building on top of our forecast models we are leveraging conversational AI to allow our users to present custom scenarios they are facing like cloud migrations, technology migrations, savings initiatives, organic efficiency improvement assumptions etc… to build long range cost estimates. These scenarios can be saved as a forecast model to be used in business strategy development. This positions our customers in an entirely different light and opens more opportunity for strategic value creation as opposed to purely historic record reporting.
- **Prebuilt Scenarios**: In addition to custom scenarios there are scenarios we can generate based off existing data like PPA negotiation impact and migration from on-premises to public cloud factoring in license cost changes(e.g. Broadcom) and custom rates in customer’s cloud of choice.

# Driving Cost Efficiency (See previous notes on continuous opt - following bullets are additive)

- **Flexible Rate Optimization**: Through our Tech Alliance Program(TAP) we have added two types of Rate Optimization options, one through Committed Use Insurance where we analyze our customers committed use purchases and present options(conservative, balanced, aggressive) to purchase reservations that optimize overall rate by including insurance on purchases so customers get the benefit without the downside risk of underutilizing commitments. The second option is automated procurement that manages the daily procurement of committed use reservations to optimize rate against usage at a fine grained level(daily). This flexibility is critical for our customers who have very different procurement patterns and comfort levels around optimizing rate.
- **Private Cloud Optimization**: We have extended our Continuous Optimization scope to Private Clouds via our Agent that manages Broadcom/VMWare, Redhat Openstack/Openshift and Nutanix environments. This allows our customers to extend waste signals and optimization policies down into private cloud scopes all managed through the same product experience.

Going forward:  

- We are expanding the scope of continuous optimization across more cloud waste scopes and technologies(e.g. data warehouses, serverless) and providing deeper reporting against optimization actions historically and in flight.

# Promoting Accountability:

- **Shared Cost Allocation**: We now have granular cost reporting for Kubernetes and managed VMWare that uses realtime utilization telemetry to distribute costs to each workload and their respective groups(tags, labels, namespace, cluster etc…). The “allocation strategies” used are entirely customizable based on business context, which is important to handle decisions like where does non-utilized cost get distributed.
- **KPIs**: Our trademarked FinOps Performance Index brings clarity and accountability to team members by measuring optimization, cost health and insight to action performance and presenting a simple 0-10 score. We allow for customization of the algorithm factors so as to make each metric score adaptable to our customer’s business context. This creates not only realtime accountability but a measurement that can be used for goal setting looking forward.
- **Anomalies**: Anomaly detection across entire multi-cloud data platform brings awareness and accountability to emergent trends before long term waste becomes detected.

Going forward:

- **KPI Alerts**: We will be adding alerting configurability to KPIs so that users and teams are made aware of significant movements and apply the correct corrective measure.
- **Anomaly Workflows**: Building on our anomaly detection capabilities we are building response workflows that allow for model feedback loops and user workflows that provide a mechanism of high responsiveness to high signal, low noise anomaly events. This workflow is similar to operational incidents in that there’s a form of awareness, triage and then remediation. We aim to resolve the chaos and low ROI that the existing anomaly detection capabilities in FinOps vendor ecosystem presently provide.


# Solution Provider:

- Increased Re-rating Flexibility: Through our continued growth in the MSP/BillOps space we’ve added a wide array of configurability for re-rating that allows MSPs to configure highly customized service offerings to their customers. New capabilities include:
    - Custom line item addition (allows for custom margins/discounts aside from upstream billing line items)
    - Improved flexibility of re-rating configuration to include/exclude specific charge types and/or tiers of service
    - Improved reporting flexibility and invoice ID generation
    - (Peter may have others worth mentioning)

Going forward:  
  

- We are approaching the GA release of BillOps v2 that is built on our new FOCUS native data platform. This introduces a new expansive tenant configuration that allows for any combination of data scoping, re-rating catalogue and report filtering that can be applied on any combination of tenants. This catalogue is then leveraged to save billing profiles or “product offerings” that can quickly be applied to classifications of customers to lower management overhead as MSP’s business scales.


# Multicloud Management

- **FOCUS**: We placed an early big bet on FOCUS, well before AWS had signed on, and rebuilt our entire data platform from ground up around this specification. That bet has paid off quite well as 5 cloud providers now are delivering FOCUS data that our platform can now leverage without any data customization as all. While other vendors will offer peripheral support for FOCUS through exports and one time ingestion APIs, our approach has been to build ground up around it knowing the other vendors would be slow to adopt.
- **Reporting**: Due to the multicloud normalization we can offer “multi-cloud first” views of everything instead of trying to aggregate each individual cloud providers version of data up. This is a game changer for multicloud customers and service providers that need to aggregate service categories across cloud providers. This also allows us to leverage the community training and awareness of FOCUS data specification so that our users have less adaptation and bespoke training to do on our product like other vendors must do.
- **Private Cloud**: We are leveraging the extensibility support of FOCUS to integrate Private Cloud inventory and cost for Broadcom/VMWare, Redhat Openstack/Openshift and Nutanix.

Going forward:  

- **Custom Metrics**: While today we can support via specific customer enhancements, we are creating a custom metric UX that allows customers to define their own metrics that are either some mutation of an existing metric or a new metric feed entirely.
- **Native Integrations for Managed SaaS Clouds**: As FinOps customers expand their scope of control into SaaS there is an increasing amount of spend in managed SaaS clouds(Elastic Cloud, Mongo Atlas, Snowflake etc…) that we will add native integrations for. Some of these SaaS providers have FOCUS support on roadmap delivery timing is not clear which raises priority for native development.
