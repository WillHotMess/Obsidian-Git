# [Old] Financial Risk Management 

Identify, troubleshoot, and resolve unauthorized or unexpected cloud costs lacking business justification to mitigate the risks of overspending, such as budget overruns. 


Edits:
```
This is really good, but looking at the criteria, I want to lean in on:
- budgeting features (pre- and post- deployment)
- Anomaly detection

For budgeting, we should lean in on how users can set quotas and budgets at any level of the business via our orchestration module that can block or steer net-new deployments (using explicit rules, approvals, or t-shirt sizing). (E.g., if a user exsits in a abusiness unit that has exhausted their quarterly budget, we can require an additional approval. We also can push/pull budgets from external sources of truth (jira, servicenow, etc)

Finally, for Anomaly Detection, 


Some of the questions that are relevant for this section: 
- Does your CFM offering support the management of cloud budget approvals before deploying resources in a cloud environment?
- Does your CFM offering trigger alerts when actual spending hits a predefined threshold of the set budget?
- Does your CFM offering trigger alerts when projected end-of-period spending is forecasted to exceed the defined budget?
- Does your CFM offering trigger alerts on detected cost anomalies?
```


## Slide 1: Opening Thesis (1 minute)

**CloudBolt's Approach:** Financial risk management isn't about putting up roadblocks - it's about awareness and steering. We believe the best risk mitigation happens when you empower teams with the right insights at the right moments, from provisioning through production.

# **Financial Risk Management**

### Slide 1: Opening Thesis (1 minute)

**CloudBolt's Approach:** "Financial risk management has two critical moments: before resources are deployed and after they're running. Most FinOps tools only address the 'after' - showing you budget overruns when it's too late. CloudBolt uniquely manages risk at both moments. Our orchestration module enforces budgets and governance BEFORE deployment through intelligent steering and approvals. Our anomaly detection catches unusual spending patterns AFTER deployment before they become financial disasters. This dual approach transforms risk management from reactive reporting to proactive prevention."

**Bold Positioning:** "We're the only platform that combines pre-deployment budget enforcement with post-deployment anomaly detection - stopping financial risk before it starts and catching it immediately when it emerges."

### Slide 2: Key Differentiators (3 minutes)

**1. Pre-Deployment Budget Governance**
- Set quotas and budgets at ANY organizational level via our orchestration module
- Intelligent steering: block, redirect, or require approvals based on budget status
- Dynamic rules engine: "If Q3 budget exhausted, require VP approval"
- T-shirt sizing with budget impact shown BEFORE provisioning
- External budget synchronization with Jira, ServiceNow, and financial systems

**2. Intelligent Anomaly Detection Engine**
- ML models create 'normal' baselines for every cost pattern
- Upper/lower boundaries adjusted for seasonality and business cycles

## Slide 3: Customer Success Story (3 minutes)

**US Bank: From Reactive Surprises to Proactive Planning**
- US Bank exemplifies our approach to financial risk management. They implemented what they call the 'fitting room' - using CloudBolt to model costs before migrating workloads to the cloud.
- Instead of discovering cost overruns after deployment, they:
	- Model different cloud scenarios before migration
	- Compare costs across providers with their specific workloads
	- Set up proactive governance that doesn't slow down innovation
- The result? They've essentially eliminated cost surprises by addressing risk at the architectural planning stage, while maintaining the agility their development teams need.

**Alstom** integrated CloudBolt with their C&P blueprint system, creating an innovative forecasting model that incorporates OpenAI for enhanced accuracy. Before any resource is provisioned, they get intelligent cost estimates based on their actual usage patterns and architectural standards.

**Allegis** built a service catalog with CloudBolt that provides real-time cost comparisons across Azure, AWS, and OCI. Their end users can see exactly what their choices will cost across different platforms before submitting requests.

# **Promoting Accountability** 

### Slide 1: Opening Thesis (1 minute)

**CloudBolt's Approach:** Accountability without action is just blame. The FinOps industry has this backwards - they focus on showing people what they spent, then wonder why behavior doesn't change. Real accountability requires two things: metrics that measure outcomes not just spend, and workflows that make remediation effortless.  CloudBolt delivers all three through our action-oriented platform that transforms cost management from a compliance exercise into a competitive advantage.

**Bold Positioning:** We're the only platform that measures FinOps success by actions taken, not reports generated - because accountability means fixing problems, not just finding them.

### Slide 2: Key Differentiators (3 minutes)

**1. Granular Shared Cost Allocation**
- Real-time utilization telemetry for Kubernetes and VMware
- Customizable allocation strategies by business context
- Configurable handling of non-utilized costs
- Hierarchical allocation from infrastructure to business unit

**2. FinOps Performance Index™ (Trademarked)**
- Simple 0-10 score measuring optimization effectiveness
- Customizable algorithm factors for business alignment
- Real-time accountability metrics
- Forward-looking goal setting capabilities

**3. Proactive Anomaly Detection**
- Multi-cloud anomaly detection before waste accumulates
- Emergent trend identification across all resources
- Team-level anomaly attribution
- Integrated alerting and escalation

The platform's "metrics that matter" approach focuses on actionable KPIs that drive efficiency improvements. The Optimization Score measures average waste level as a percentage of total spend over time, directly indicating workload efficiency. Cost Health provides a hygiene metric combining rate optimization, budget adherence, forecast accuracy, and unit cost trends to assess overall financial efficiency. Insight to Action Lead Time tracks the time between optimization opportunity discovery and implementation, measuring organizational responsiveness to efficiency improvements. These KPIs work together to provide a comprehensive view of how effectively cloud resources generate business value, enabling organizations to identify inefficiencies and track improvement over time.

### Slide 3: Customer Success Story (3 minutes)

# **Maximizing Business Value**

### Slide 1: Opening Thesis (1 minute)

**CloudBolt's Approach:** "Business value isn't about reducing cloud costs - it's about ensuring every dollar spent drives business outcomes. But here's the challenge: most organizations can't even answer basic questions like 'What does our mobile app cost to run?' across hybrid infrastructure. CloudBolt solves this through the industry's most sophisticated cost allocation engine, built on FOCUS from the ground up. We don't just allocate costs - we connect them to the business contexts that matter, enabling true unit economics across your entire technology estate."

# Driving Cost Efficiency:

## Slide 1: Opening Thesis (1 minute)

**CloudBolt's Approach:** Here's the uncomfortable truth: the average enterprise wastes 32% of their cloud spend. Not because they don't know about it - they have dashboards full of optimization recommendations. The problem is the massive gap between identifying waste and actually eliminating it. While the industry builds more reporting tools, CloudBolt built something fundamentally different: a continuous optimization platform that doesn't just find waste - it eliminates it automatically, 24/7, across your entire cloud fabric.

**Bold Positioning:** We're the only FinOps platform that measures success not by how many recommendations we generate, but by how much waste we actually eliminate. Because showing you the problem isn't solving it.

## Slide 2: Key Differentiators (3 minutes)

# Service Provider

## Slide 1: Opening Thesis (1 minute)

**CloudBolt's Approach:** "Most FinOps vendors treat service providers as an afterthought - they build for enterprises, then try to retrofit multi-tenancy. That's backwards. Service providers aren't just large enterprises - they're fundamentally different businesses with unique requirements around billing, distribution, and customer management. CloudBolt is uniquely positioned because we didn't just add billing features - we built a distinct platform that serves both enterprise FinOps AND the complex needs of cloud distributors. Until 2023, service providers were our largest customer base. We know this market."

**Bold Positioning:** "We're the only vendor that offers true billing and distribution capabilities alongside enterprise-grade FinOps - because we understand that service providers need to transform cloud financial management from a cost center into a profit center."

# Multicloud Management 

## Slide 1: Opening Thesis (1 minute)

**CloudBolt's Approach:** "Multi-cloud isn't just about having dashboards for AWS, Azure, and GCP anymore. Today's reality includes VMware environments, Kubernetes clusters sprawled across providers, and hundreds of SaaS applications. The industry's dirty secret? Most 'multi-cloud' solutions are just single-cloud tools duct-taped together. CloudBolt took a fundamentally different approach - we rebuilt our entire data platform from the ground up on FOCUS, the open standard for cloud billing. This isn't cosmetic standardization - it's architectural. Every cost, every resource, every metric flows through the same normalized model, whether it's from a hyperscaler or your on-premise VMware cluster."

**Bold Positioning:** "We're the only platform that delivers true multi-cloud financial management through native FOCUS adoption - not as an export format, but as our core data architecture. One platform, one experience, every cloud."

## Slide 2: Key Differentiators (3 minutes)

**1. Ground-Up FOCUS Architecture**
- Early adopter before AWS commitment
- Native ingestion without data customization
- Immediate support for new FOCUS providers
- Not retrofitted - architecturally native

**2. True Multi-Cloud First Reporting**
- Normalized views across all providers by default
- Service category aggregation without translation
- Leverages community FOCUS knowledge
- Reduced training and onboarding time

**3. Comprehensive Cloud Coverage**
- Private cloud via FOCUS extensions (VMware, OpenStack, Nutanix)
- Native FOCUS ingestion from 5+ providers
- Agent-based conversion for non-FOCUS sources
- Unified experience regardless of infrastructure

## Slide 3: Customer Success Story (3 minutes)

**Multi-Cloud Excellence in Action**
"Let me show you what true multi-cloud management looks like. We have customers managing complex environments spanning:
- Traditional workloads on VMware
- Cloud-native applications across AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Kubernetes clusters distributed across all providers
- Hundreds of SaaS applications

Before CloudBolt, they needed different tools, different teams, and different processes for each environment. Costs were siloed, optimization was fragmented, and governance was inconsistent.

With our FOCUS-based platform:
- Single source of truth for ALL cloud costs
- Consistent optimization recommendations whether it's a VM or a container
- Unified governance policies that work everywhere
- Normalized reporting that executives actually understand

One customer told us: 'For the first time, we can answer what we're spending on email - whether it's Exchange on VMware, Office 365, or Gmail. That's the power of true normalization.'

The result? 40% reduction in tool sprawl, 60% faster reporting cycles, and millions in savings from previously invisible cross-cloud optimization opportunities."

## Slide 4: Investment Themes (2 minutes)

**Custom Metrics Platform**

- New metric feed integration
- Business-specific KPI support

**Managed SaaS Cloud Integration**
- Native support for Elastic Cloud, MongoDB Atlas, Snowflake
- Direct API integration where FOCUS unavailable
- Unified cost model across all SaaS providers
- Automated discovery and classification

**FOCUS Ecosystem Leadership**
- Contributing extensions back to standard
- Driving adoption with private cloud vendors
- Building FOCUS conversion tools
- Creating industry best practices

## Slide 5: Bottom-Line Conclusion (1 minute)

**Business Impact:** CloudBolt customers achieve something remarkable - they manage their entire cloud estate, from legacy VMware to cutting-edge Kubernetes, with the same team, same processes, and same platform. No more Excel gymnastics to merge reports. No more blind spots in hybrid environments. Just unified visibility and control that drives 35% better cloud ROI across their entire technology portfolio.

**Market Leadership:** While competitors talk about multi-cloud, we've built it. By being the first to adopt FOCUS as our core architecture, not just an export format, we've created the industry's only true multi-cloud financial management platform. That's why enterprises with the most complex, heterogeneous environments choose CloudBolt - because 'multi-cloud' isn't just a checkbox for us, it's our foundation.
