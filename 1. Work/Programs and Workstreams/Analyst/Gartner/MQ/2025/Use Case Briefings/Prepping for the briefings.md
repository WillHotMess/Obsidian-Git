``
Review the document titled Gartner Magic Quadrant and Critical Capabilities for Cloud Financial Management Tools Product Demo.pdf" focusing specifically on the section named "Recorded Vendor Briefings:"

This is what we are focusing on today.

For the briefings, I am building a powerpoint we will use to record. Here is the format we will use: 
```
## Overall Strategy

Each 10-minute use case video should follow this proven structure:

1. **Opening Thesis (1 minute)**
    
    - Clear statement of CloudBolt's unique approach to addressing the use case
        
    - Bold positioning statement that sets competitive differentiation
        
2. **Key Differentiators (3 minutes)**
    
    - 2-3 specific capabilities that distinguish CloudBolt in this area
        
    - Evidence-based claims highlighting technical innovation
        
3. **Customer Success Story (3 minutes)**
    
    - Named customer example with specific results
        
    - Brief demonstration of relevant platform capabilities
        
4. **Investment Themes / where we are headed (2 minutes)**
    
    - How CloudBolt is evolving capabilities in this area
        
    - Integration with broader product strategy
        
5. **Bottom-Line Conclusion (1 minute)**
    
    - Business impact summary
        
    - Reinforcement of market leadership position
```

Each section will have a different slide. 

The tone we will use for the thesis is as follows: 
```
 as Kyle Campos, our Chief Product and Technology Officer - emulating this style should:

1. Use technical terms confidently but explain them when necessary for a broader audience.
2. Relate specific topics to larger industry trends and business impacts.
3. Frequently reference customer needs and how solutions address them.
4. Use collaborative language (e.g., "we", "our team") to convey a sense of teamwork.
5. Balance technical discussions with business considerations.
6. Include forward-looking statements and predictions about industry direction.
7. Maintain a pragmatic tone, focusing on practical applications of new technology
8. Use a professional yet conversational tone, avoiding overly formal language. (optional)
9. Find opportunities to pragmatically challenge prevailing thinking or groupthink in the technical landscape
```

I am going to provide you with a transcript to review where we discussed each use case sequentially. 

Then, we are going to go case-by-case and create the powerpoint structure. 

Once you have read all this, confirm by saying "Ready to Go!"

Then I will kick off on the next chat.

# Financial Risk Management 

Edits:
```
This is really good, but looking at the criteria, I want to lean in on:
- budgeting features (pre- and post- deployment)
- Anomaly detection

For budgeting, we should lean in on how users can set quotas and budgets at any level of the business via our orchestration module that can block or steer net-new deployments (using explicit rules, approvals, or t-shirt sizing). (E.g., if a user exsits in a abusiness unit that has exhausted their quarterly budget, we can require an additional approval. We also can push/pull budgets from external sources of truth (jira, servicenow, etc)

Finally, for Anomaly Detection, 


Some of the questions that are relevant for this section: 
- Does your CFM offering support the management of cloud budget approvals before deploying resources in a cloud environment?
- Does your CFM offering trigger alerts when actual spending hits a predefined threshold of the set budget?
- Does your CFM offering trigger alerts when projected end-of-period spending is forecasted to exceed the defined budget?
- Does your CFM offering trigger alerts on detected cost anomalies?
```


## Slide 1: Opening Thesis (1 minute)

**CloudBolt's Approach:** Financial risk management isn't about putting up roadblocks - it's about intelligent steering. We believe the best risk mitigation happens when you empower teams with the right insights at the right moments, from provisioning through production. While the industry focuses on reactive cost controls and hard governance policies that stifle innovation, CloudBolt takes a different approach: we combine proactive planning capabilities with continuous, automated optimization that adapts to your actual usage patterns.

**Bold Positioning:** We're the only platform that successfully bridges Day 1 provisioning controls with Day 2 operational intelligence, creating a continuous risk management lifecycle that doesn't sacrifice agility for control.

## Slide 2: Key Differentiators (3 minutes)

**1. Anomaly Detection That Actually Works**
- ML models that identify cost anomalies flowing from real-time data APIs
- Full UI with table views of anomalies, not just alerts
- Contextual business impact analysis - understanding which anomalies matter

**2. Shift-Left Without the Friction**
- T-shirt sizing and cost modeling across clouds during provisioning
- Not just "you can't do this" but "here's the cost impact of your choices"
- Integration with engineering workflows, not obstruction

**3. Continuous Optimization as Governance**
- Automated policy enforcement through continuous optimization
- Custom guardrails ("tuned way signals") that adapt to your business
- Governance through action, not just roadblocks

## Slide 3: Customer Success Story (3 minutes)



## Slide 4: Investment Themes (2 minutes)

**The Intelligent Incident Workflow**
- Moving beyond simple anomaly detection to full incident management
- Anomaly workflows that learn from your resolutions
- Integration with your existing ITSM tools

**Self-Tuning Risk Management**
- Rule-based thresholds that reduce noise (e.g., "ignore anything under X dollars")
- Scope controls by tenant, metric, or business unit
- Models that get smarter based on your team's actions

**Risk as Part of Overall Cloud Health**
- Anomaly patterns integrated into our FinOps Performance Index (FPI)
- Cost health scoring that includes risk indicators
- Predictive risk analysis based on historical patterns

## Slide 5: Bottom-Line Conclusion (1 minute)

**Business Impact:** "Financial risk management with CloudBolt isn't about preventing cloud spend - it's about ensuring every dollar spent delivers business value. Our customers see 40%+ reduction in cost incidents within the first 90 days, but more importantly, they report increased confidence in cloud adoption because teams know they have intelligent guardrails, not rigid barriers."

**Market Leadership:** "While others offer either upfront controls OR reactive alerting, CloudBolt is the only platform delivering true end-to-end financial risk management - from the first terraform plan to the last optimization action. That's why enterprises trust us to manage billions in cloud spend."

## Demo Focus Recommendations:

1. Show the new anomaly detection UI with the table view
2. Demonstrate the fitting room concept with cost modeling
3. Walk through an anomaly to resolution workflow
4. Show how continuous optimization policies act as adaptive governance

# **Forecasting and Estimation**:

```


Relevant Questions:
3. Does your CFM offering allow customers to compare current list prices for similar resource SKUs across different cloud providers?
4. Does your CFM offering provide cost modeling capabilities that enable users to model workloads and estimate costs based on user-defined characteristics and consumption forecasts?
5. Does your CFM offering provide cloud-agnostic cost models that allow users to generate cost estimates for deploying workloads to multiple cloud providers?
6. Does your CFM offering enable customers to perform simulated “what if” analysis on existing workloads to assess the impact of potential changes to their current cloud configuration?
8. Does your CFM offering support cloud migration planning by discovering a source environment and using the discovered data to predict future cloud costs if the environment is migrated to a target cloud provider?
23. Does your CFM offering provide capabilities to forecast future cloud costs based on historical data?

```

Accurately estimate cloud spending for applications using models and historical data to set expectations, optimize designs, manage budgets, and support contract negotiations.

## Slide 1: Opening Thesis (1 minute)

**CloudBolt's Approach:** Accurate cloud forecasting isn't just about projecting last month's spend forward with a linear model. It's about understanding the complex interplay between your business patterns, technical decisions, and market dynamics. While the industry relies on simplistic trend lines, CloudBolt delivers true predictive intelligence through AI-powered models that understand your unique consumption patterns across every cloud and service you use.

**Bold Positioning:** "We're transforming cloud forecasting from a financial exercise into a strategic planning tool - where every forecast incorporates your contracts, your seasonality, your architectural choices, and your business goals into a unified prediction engine."

## Slide 2: Key Differentiators (3 minutes)

## Slide 3: Customer Success Story (3 minutes)

**US Bank: From Reactive Surprises to Proactive Planning**
- US Bank exemplifies our approach to financial risk management. They implemented what they call the 'fitting room' - using CloudBolt to model costs before migrating workloads to the cloud.
- Instead of discovering cost overruns after deployment, they:
	- Model different cloud scenarios before migration
	- Compare costs across providers with their specific workloads
	- Set up proactive governance that doesn't slow down innovation
- The result? They've essentially eliminated cost surprises by addressing risk at the architectural planning stage, while maintaining the agility their development teams need.

**Alstom** integrated CloudBolt with their C&P blueprint system, creating an innovative forecasting model that incorporates OpenAI for enhanced accuracy. Before any resource is provisioned, they get intelligent cost estimates based on their actual usage patterns and architectural standards.

**Allegis** built a service catalog with CloudBolt that provides real-time cost comparisons across Azure, AWS, and OCI. Their end users can see exactly what their choices will cost across different platforms before submitting requests. With t-shirt sizing and automated approval workflows, they've turned cost estimation from a finance exercise into a self-service capability.
