### **Video Preface Statements for Gartner Critical Capabilities**

1. Architectural Design Support
"At CloudBolt, we believe cost efficiency begins the moment a new resource is conceived. That’s why our platform provides Architectural Design Support to ensure your teams make the right cost-aware decisions from the start. This includes (a) multi-cloud and hybrid cost modeling before deployment, (b) cross-provider price comparisons for true economic analysis, (c) "what-if" scenario planning for modern Kubernetes workloads, and (d) codifying best practices into automated governance so every new design is cost-effective."

2. Cost Allocation

"At CloudBolt, we believe that true financial accountability requires allocating every dollar of cloud spend with clear business context. That’s why our platform, built on the FOCUS open standard, provides a uniquely flexible and granular allocation engine. This includes (a) advanced tag governance and normalization to clean up inconsistent data, (b) flexible rules to split the costs of shared infrastructure, and (c) market-leading Kubernetes allocation that even attributes the cost of unused capacity to drive accountability."

3. Cost Reporting

"At CloudBolt, we believe every stakeholder, from the engineer to the CFO, needs cost visibility tailored to their specific role and questions. That’s why we deliver immediate, persona-driven insights that reflect your organization's true financial landscape. This includes (a) out-of-the-box FOCUS-native dashboards that are deeply customizable, (b) AI-powered forecasting for accurate budget planning, and (c) unique support for integrating real-world financials like negotiated rates, amortized commitments, and reseller markups."

4. Unit Economics

"At CloudBolt, we believe the ultimate goal of FinOps is to connect cloud spend directly to business value and outcomes. That’s why we are building toward true unit cost analysis by first establishing a powerful framework of cloud efficiency KPIs that act as a proxy for business value. This includes (a) tracking your 'Optimization Score' to measure workload efficiency, (b) monitoring your 'Cost Health Score' for financial hygiene, and (c) measuring 'Insight-to-Action Time' to gauge organizational effectiveness, all while our dedicated derived unit cost analytics capabilities are on the near-term roadmap."

5. Budget and Incident Detection

"At CloudBolt, we believe modern budget management must be proactive, not reactive. That's why our platform is designed to prevent overspending before it happens and automate the response when incidents inevitably occur. This includes (a) pre-deployment budget approvals that stop costly deployments in their tracks, (b) AI-powered anomaly detection to identify unexpected cost spikes, and (c) automated response actions that can be triggered by a budget alert to contain costs immediately."

6. Workload Optimization

"At CloudBolt, we believe optimization shouldn't just be a report; it must be a continuous, automated process that delivers realized savings. That’s why we deliver 'Continuous Optimization' powered by market-leading AI/ML. This includes (a) deep rightsizing and idle resource management for IaaS and PaaS, (b) industry-leading Kubernetes optimization powered by our StormForge engine, and (c) a policy-based automation framework that closes the loop from insight to action."

7. Commitment Management

"At CloudBolt, we believe maximizing savings from Reserved Instances and Savings Plans shouldn't require taking on unacceptable financial risk. That’s why we de-risk and automate the entire commitment lifecycle with unparalleled flexibility. This includes (a) intelligent, risk-aware purchase recommendations, (b) automated lifecycle management, and (c) our unique 'Guaranteed RI' sellback option that allows you to exit commitments at any time, eliminating long-term risk."

8. Remediation Management

"At CloudBolt, we believe closing the gap between a cost-saving insight and an engineering action is the defining challenge of a successful FinOps practice. That’s why our Cloud Native Actions framework provides a fully auditable and automated workflow from detection to resolution. This includes (a) a native, multi-stage approval engine, (b) policy-driven automation for hands-off execution, and (c) seamless, bi-directional integrations with the ITSM tools your engineers already use, like ServiceNow and Jira."

9. KPI Tracking

"At CloudBolt, we believe you can't improve what you can't measure, and FinOps maturity is about more than just cost savings. That’s why we provide a comprehensive framework to measure the effectiveness and business value of your entire FinOps practice. This includes (a) our proprietary FinOps Performance Index (FPI™) for a holistic view of maturity, (b) clear tracking of both potential and realized savings to prove ROI, and (c) a unique ability to benchmark your performance against anonymized industry peers."

10. Cloud Reselling

"At CloudBolt, we believe service providers need a dedicated platform, not a generic workaround, to efficiently and profitably manage their cloud business. That’s why we built a native BillOps Platform from the ground up for the specific needs of MSPs and resellers. This includes (a) true multi-tenancy with isolated customer portals, (b) sophisticated margin control through custom re-rating, (c) commitment resale capabilities, and (d) full white-labeling for a seamless customer experience."

11. Cloud Provider Support

"At CloudBolt, we believe true multi-cloud financial management requires absolute data consistency and feature parity across all of your environments—public, private, and hybrid. That’s why we have architected our platform on the FOCUS open standard to provide a single, consistent experience for your entire IT estate. This includes (a) deep, native support for AWS, Azure, GCP, and OCI; (b) extensive private cloud capabilities for VMware and Nutanix; and (c) a consistent data model that enables true cross-cloud analysis and reporting."
