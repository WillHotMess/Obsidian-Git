---

### Question 9: What are one to two areas where your solution excels?

**1. FOCUS-Native Architecture - The Foundation for True Multi-Cloud Management**

CloudBolt is the first and only platform rebuilt entirely on the FOCUS (FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification) standard. While competitors treat FOCUS as an afterthought or export format, we've made it our core data architecture. This fundamental difference provides:

- **Perfect Data Normalization:** Every piece of cost and usage data from every cloud provider is immediately normalized into a consistent format. This eliminates the data translation issues that plague other platforms and ensures apple-to-apple comparisons across clouds.

- **Future-Proof Design:** As new cloud providers and services adopt FOCUS, they automatically integrate with our platform without requiring custom development. This protects customer investments and ensures long-term viability.

- **Vendor Independence:** Customers own their data in an industry-standard format, eliminating vendor lock-in. They can export, analyze, and migrate their data without proprietary format constraints.

- **Simplified Integration:** Any tool that speaks FOCUS can seamlessly integrate with CloudBolt, creating an open ecosystem rather than a walled garden.

**Customer Impact:** Suncorp achieved 99% cost allocation accuracy across their complex multi-cloud environment, eliminating months of manual reconciliation work and departmental disputes over cloud charges.

**2. Closing the Insight-to-Action Gap Through Continuous Optimization**

The FinOps industry's fundamental challenge isn't identifying waste—it's eliminating it. Most platforms stop at showing dashboards of optimization opportunities, leaving the actual implementation to manual processes that never get completed. CloudBolt's Cloud Native Actions framework revolutionizes this through:

- **Automated Execution:** Our platform doesn't just recommend rightsizing—it actually implements it through direct API calls. Policies can be configured to automatically execute approved optimizations without human intervention.

- **Policy-Driven Intelligence:** Organizations codify their optimization preferences once (e.g., "rightsize all development instances weekly," "terminate untagged resources after 72 hours"), and the platform continuously enforces these policies.

- **Measured Impact:** We track both identified and realized savings with full attribution. Customers can see exactly which automations delivered which savings, proving ROI with precision.

- **Risk Mitigation:** Our framework includes safety controls like gradual rollout, automatic rollback on performance degradation, and approval workflows for high-impact changes.

**Customer Evidence:** US Bank reduced their Kubernetes costs by over 50% through automated optimization, transforming months of manual work into minutes of automated execution. Their "Fitting Room" approach using our ML-powered optimization prevented several performance-related outages while dramatically reducing costs.
