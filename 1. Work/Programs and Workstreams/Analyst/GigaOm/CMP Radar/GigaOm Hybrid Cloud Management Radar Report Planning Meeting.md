## Summary

The team gathered to discuss the upcoming GigaOm Hybrid Cloud Management (HCM) Radar Report submission due next Monday. Mark explained that while AR efforts were initially deprioritized for the year, several analyst reports have emerged requiring attention, particularly this HCM report where CloudBolt has previously performed well. William will lead the response effort with input from Mike and Augie, focusing on incorporating recent product developments including StormForge integration and future roadmap items. The team agreed on a collaborative approach to develop the submission, with William creating an initial draft leveraging previous submissions and the team providing targeted input in their areas of expertise.

## Agenda

- Initial product communication discussion (unplanned)
- Context for the GigaOm Hybrid Cloud Management Radar Report
- Discussion of submission approach and timeline
- Review of key product innovations and roadmap items to include
- Assignment of responsibilities

## Discussion Notes

### Product Communication Issues
- Mike and William discussed challenges with internal communication about product releases and feature availability
- Identified inconsistencies in communicating when features like OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) and cost reports are available to customers
- Agreed on need to improve processes for product marketing coordination
- William emphasized the importance of not announcing features before they're actually available to customers

### GigaOm Radar Report Context
- Mark explained that AR was initially deprioritized but several reports have emerged, including:
    - Unexpected Gartner MQ for Cloud Financial Management
    - Forrester Wave coming earlier than expected
    - Multiple GigaOm reports, with HCM being particularly important
- CloudBolt historically performed well with GigaOm, ranking #2 previously with minimal submission effort
- HCM category previously deprecated but now revitalized with convergence of FinOps, cloud resource optimization, and cloud management
- Dana Gardner (analyst) has a good relationship with CloudBolt and enjoys working with the team
- Submission deadline is next Monday, with potential briefing next Tuesday

### Product Roadmap and Innovation Highlights

Augie outlined several key areas of product innovation to emphasize:

1. **Forecasting & Cost Predictions**
    
    - Integration of real customer discount rates and agreements for accurate forecasting
    - Using CloudBolt's FinOps knowledge for more accurate cross-cloud cost comparisons
    - Moving beyond list price to real tenant-specific rates
    - Potential to incorporate optimization recommendations based on usage patterns
2. **AI/ML Integration**
    
    - Extending StormForge ML modules for right-sizing beyond Kubernetes to all workloads
    - Using AI for more natural language blueprint deployment
    - Leveraging AI for workload placement recommendations
3. **Zero-Touch Release**
    
    - Representing CloudBolt HCM ecosystem in code
    - API-based approach integrating with Git repositories
    - Maintaining state awareness through versioning
    - Enabling push-button deployment of configurations
4. **Security Enhancements**
    
    - Supporting secret management standards
    - Integration with tools like Vault, CyberArc, and Keeper
    - Real-time secret retrieval at usage time
5. **Monitoring Integration**
    
    - Balancing native monitoring capabilities with enterprise tool integration
    - Supporting "best of breed" monitoring platforms
    - Differentiating from competitors like Morpheus who attempt both but execute poorly
6. **Kubernetes Support Enhancement**
    
    - Adding Helm chart support similar to Terraform integration
    - Simplifying Kubernetes complexity through blueprint abstraction
    - StormForge integration for container orchestration
