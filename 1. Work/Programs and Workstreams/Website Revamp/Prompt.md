# Prompt: You are a consultative agent who is expert product marketing leader and seasoned marketing copywriter at a SaaS portfolio company, who is working on a website redesign. Today's goal is to draft the "Hero Pages" for our main solutions (Cloud Management, Kubernetes Rightsizing, Cloud FinOps, Cloud BillOps). 

# Here is your task: 
## First, I am going to share our overall principles for product positioning in the form of questions. I want you to review them, and ensure that we consider them thematically throughout our copy writing.

### Questions: 

### **Section 1: Setting the Stage (The First 5 Seconds)**

_Focus on the content "above the fold" that creates the critical first impression._

| #     | Guiding Question                                                                                                                  | Core Principle (Why it Matters)                                                                                                |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | What **market category** are we placing our product in with our headline, and does this choice make our unique strengths obvious? | Your headline sets the context. A good category choice makes your value instantly understandable; a bad one creates confusion. |
| **2** | Does the sub-header immediately identify **who this is for** and hint at the primary **value** they will receive?                 | Attract your "best-fit" customers and signal the core benefit right away. This acts as a powerful filter.                      |
| **3** | Does the hero section's content (text and visuals) pass the **"quacks like a duck" test** for our chosen market category?         | Your design and tone must match the expectations of your declared market. Mismatches erode trust.                              |

### **Section 2: The Core Narrative (Building the Case)**

_Focus on the body of the page that builds the persuasive argument for your solution._

|#|Guiding Question|Core Principle (Why it Matters)|
|---|---|---|
|**4**|Do we clearly name the customer's _**actual**_ **competitive alternative**, not just our direct product competitors?|Customers compare you to their current process (e.g., spreadsheets, doing nothing). Acknowledge their reality to build trust.|
|**5**|For every unique feature we mention, have we immediately translated it into **customer value**?|Never list a feature without its benefit. Answer the customer's "So what?" question for them.|
|**6**|Is every claim of value backed up by concrete, believable **proof** in close proximity?|A claim without proof (customer quotes, data, logos) is just marketing fluff. Proof makes value believable.|
|**7**|Does our language speak exclusively to our **"best-fit" customer**, even if it risks alienating others?|Trying to appeal to everyone appeals to no one. Use the specific language and examples of your target segment.|
|**8**|Are we clearly playing one of the three games: **"Head to Head," "Big Fish, Small Pond," or "Create a New Game"?**|Your page's narrative must align with your chosen market strategy for winning. Consistency is key to a believable story.|

### **Section 3: Creating Urgency & Driving Action**

_Focus on compelling the visitor to take the next step._

|#|Guiding Question|Core Principle (Why it Matters)|
|---|---|---|
|**9**|Does this page give the visitor a compelling reason why they should solve this problem **right now**?|Connect your product's value to a relevant trend or external pressure to overcome customer inertia. Answer "Why now?".|
|**10**|Is the **call-to-action (CTA)** a logical, low-friction next step for our target customer?|Match the CTA to the visitor's stage of awareness. Make it easy for them to say "yes" (e.g., "Request a Demo" vs. "Buy Now").|

### **Section 4: The Granular Review (Auditing Every Word)**

_Focus on the fine details that make copy sharp and effective._

| #      | Guiding Question                                                                      | Core Principle (Why it Matters)                                                                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **11** | Does this block/sentence reinforce our core **value themes**, or is it a distraction? | A strong position is focused. Cut anything that doesn't support your main one-to-four value propositions.          |
| **12** | Is this written from the customer's point of view, or is it **"we-we" copy**?         | Use "You" more than "We." Focus on the customer's outcome, not your company's features.                            |
| **13** | Have we used the **simplest, most direct word** possible?                             | Clarity is the goal. Ruthlessly eliminate jargon and complex business-speak.                                       |
| **14** | Could a **competitor truthfully make this exact same statement**?                     | If a claim is generic ("easy to use," "world-class support"), it's not a differentiator. Be specific and provable. |
| **15** | Does this page reflect our **customer positioning**, not our investor positioning?    | Customers buy a solution to a problem they have now. Save the 10-year vision for your investor deck.               |

## Second, I am going to share an example of a website that we want to model our site from that follows the taxonomy below: 
<
1. Eyebrow: Direct product name (ex. "Cloud Management Platform") 
2. Headline: Clear Product or Market Category, with a differentiation twist. (ex. "Modern Cloud Management built for the reality of hybrid IT" or "Cloud FinOps Tool Designed for Action, Not Alerts")
3. Subheader: Roll-up of the value proposition (below)
4. Value Proposition: 3-4 primary use-cases and beenfits the solution we are focusing on. 
5. Primary Features: The features that help make the value proposition true
6. Proof Points: 
7. Customer Quotes: Use a placeholder here
8. Call-to-Action:
