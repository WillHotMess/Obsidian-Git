Refactor this email to be most effective, in a friendly, conscise but explanatory way. 

Operate as though the more defined and clear you are the better. The real goal of this is to set clear expecatations to the leadership team around the timelines and scope of the website revamp. We are wrapping that in what should read as a offsite recap/readout for executive leaders.

I want to thank the entire marketing team for the long hours this week supporting our website revitalization project.  This week, the team was hard at work, going from analysis, to ideation, to strategy, to hands on keyboard drafting. We walk away from this week, with a significant portion of the planning and drafting work done; achieving weeks worth of work in mere days, 

I felt it important to share the outputs of this week, and what comes next.  Over the coming days, weeks, and months, we will be revitalizing the CloudBolt website to best showcase our current go-to-market solutions using our redefined positioning language centered around the Build, Manage, Optimize thematic device. 

Our goals for this off-site were the following: 
1. Our the ultimate goal of ensuring the various personas who are looking for different solutions can easily find what they are looking for - without having to dig. 
	1. Ensure that our site best represents our priority go-to-market motions.  Which include: 
		1. Cloud Management 
		2. Kubernetes Rightsizing 
		3. Cloud Reselling 
		4. Cloud FinOps 
	2. Ensure that our home page shows the best of our solution portfolio in a manner that tells a connected story but does not water down or confuse the differing solutions. 
2. We also wanted to make sure that the website spoke directly to these personas in a clear, easy to understand, way. Wherein, customers do not need to burn too many mental calories to understand what we do, and why we are different. 
3. Ensure our website is conversion-forward. We want customers to always be near a conversion point. 
	1. Add an interactive form to the top of home page (examples from nOps and CloudZero)
	2. Ensure every page has a “book a demo” button at the top. 
	3. StormForge pages have free trial and AWS marketplace buttons added
4. Better represent the StormForge brand as a standalone product as well as a value proposition of Cloud FinOps
	1. Add Kubernetes Rightsizing as its own solution to the home page
	2. Pull from the pre-existing StormForge website copy from their product and solution pages. 
5. Ensure that all the goodness of our recent releases is included in our site copy, including: 
	1. Cloud FinOps 
		1. Forecasting 
		2. Anomaly Detection 
		3. Hybrid Cloud Support
	2. StormForge
		1. JVM / Java Heap Optimization
6. Knowing that skimming is a more common user scenario, tell a more visual story across our site: 
	1. Reimagine the home page to be far more visually pleasing with thematic visuals from the header to the footer. 
	2. Create interactive sections that tell a comprehensive story across Build, Manage, and Optimize functions. 
	3. Use graphics that are derived from our product UI/UX, examples: 
		1. Sankey Charts from CB Platform 
		2. K8s performance graphs from StormForge
		3. Catalog Experience in CMP 
		4. Tenancy Creation in BillOps 
	4. Use motion graphics build, grow, or adapt as users interact, an experience that “shows” rather than “tells” 
	5. 	4. Create Zinger Videos and StoryLane walkthroughs specific to product functionality are linked and throughout use case and capability pages
7. Reimagine the Navigation 
	1. Moving from “junk drawer” “catch-all” to a direct “get where you need to go” experience
	2. Add subheadings that easily explain what users can find on a page, 
	3. Here is a small example of these themes from the solution section: 
		1. Solutions
			1. Key Use Cases
				1. Cloud Management 
				2. Kubernetes Rightsizing 
				3. Cloud Reselling
				4. Cloud FinOps
			2. Personas
				1. Engineering
				2. Finance
				3. IT Leadership 
				4. Government
				5. Service Provider
			3. Capabilities
				1. Hybrid Cloud Orchestration
				2. Reporting and Allocation
				3. Service Provider Resell
				4. Continuous Optimization 
				5. 
				6. Kubernetes Optimization
				7. 
			4. Why CloudBolt (Build, Manage, Optimize story)


What’s listed above are extremely lofty goals that we plan on rolling out throughout Q3. Much of this can be rolled quickly and without much overhead, but some of this will require site architecture changes and support from our website agency. 

With that said, here is a brief overview of our time horizons: 
- This week:
	- All copy for Home page signed off and ready.
	- All copy for solution “Hero” pages signed off and ready. 
	- Final verbiage and layout for navigation signed off and ready
	- Final Capabilities and Personas selected and signed off (not drafted)
	- Rough understanding from our website agency as to scope, timeline, and costs of ”good, better, best” project. 
	- ExComm + ELT “Show and Tell” with early mockups =
- By July 31st
	- Hero pages (copy only) in production
	- Persona pages (copy only) in production 
	- Capability pages (copy only) in production 
	- V1 of Home Page in production 
		- Verbiage updates only
	- V1 of navigation in production
	- Home Page graphics and interactive section storyboard, copy, and mock-ups completed.

	- All in-house graphics (derived product renders, motion graphics / gifs, and non-home page headers) completed and in production. 
	- Demo, free trial, and marketplace button placement across pages
	- Finalize Zinger videos and StoryLane demos and link in relevant sections

Coming Week (July 14-18)
We’re focused on finalizing all the foundational content, scoping with our agency, and meeting with ELT to share timelines/mockups/drafts. 


End of Month:
This is our first major milestone where content goes live. We’ll have Hero pages, Persona pages, and Capability pages deployed, along with Homepage V1 that includes copy updates but not the major visual changes yet. The V1 navigation updates will also be live, and we’ll have all in-house graphics completed with interactive sections fully storyboarded. By this point, agency estimates should be finalized and approved so we know exactly what Phase 2 looks like.
August 21st (Enhanced Features)
This phase focuses on functionality and engagement. All in-house graphics go live, demo/trial/marketplace buttons get deployed across every relevant page, and we’ll have Zinger videos and StoryLane demos created and integrated throughout the experience. The full navigation experience will be live at this point.
TBD - Phase 2 (The Big Stuff)
The major visual overhaul happens here - interactive homepage form, complete visual transformation of the home page, and interactive graphic rails. Timeline for Phase 2 depends entirely on agency capacity and budget approval. We could either accelerate this into late Q3 or push to Q4 depending on priorities and resource allocation.
