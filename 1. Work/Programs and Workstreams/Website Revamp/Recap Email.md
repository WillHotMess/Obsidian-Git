# Website Revitalization Project - Executive Readout

**Website Revamp: What We Accomplished This Week + What's Next**

---

I want to thank our marketing team for their exceptional dedication this week during our website revitalization planning intensive. In just five days, we accomplished what typically would have taken several weeks—moving from analysis through strategy to hands-on content drafting.

Below is a summary of outlines our strategic approach, project scope, and execution timeline for revitalizing the CloudBolt website to better showcase our go-to-market solutions using our refined "Build, Manage, Optimize" positioning framework.


## What We're Solving For

Our current website has a fundamental problem: our personas can't easily find what they're looking for. We're asking potential customers to burn too many mental calories just to understand what we do. That needs to change.

Here's how we're approaching this:

### **1. Persona-Driven Navigation That Actually Works**

Right now, our site is essentially a "junk drawer" - everything's there, but good luck finding it quickly. We're redesigning around four core go-to-market motions:
- Cloud Management
- Kubernetes Rightsizing
- Cloud Reselling
- Cloud FinOps

### **2. Conversion-Forward Throughout**

To maximize conversion, we're putting CTAs everywhere they make sense:
- Interactive homepage form (following what nOps and CloudZero are doing)
- "Book a Demo" buttons on every page - no exceptions
- StormForge pages get free trial + AWS Marketplace buttons


### **3. StormForge Brand Clarity**

We plan to represent StormForge both as a standalone product and as part of our broader Cloud FinOps story. We're adding Kubernetes Rightsizing as its own solution on the homepage and pulling the best copy from their existing product pages.

### **4. Visual Storytelling That Shows, Doesn't Tell**

Our current site is too text-heavy. We're moving to:
- Product UI-derived graphics (Sankey charts from CB Platform, K8s performance graphs from StormForge)
- Interactive "Build, Manage, Optimize" sections
- Motion graphics that actually demonstrate our capabilities
- StoryLane walkthroughs linked throughout

### **5. Navigation That Makes Sense**

Here is an example of what the new structure will look like:

```
Solutions
├── Key Use Cases
│   ├── Cloud Management, Kubernetes Rightsizing, Cloud Reselling, Cloud FinOps
├── Personas
│   ├── Engineering, Finance, IT Leadership
│   └── Government, Service Provider
├── Capabilities
│   ├── Reporting and Allocation: Connect cloud spend to business
│   ├── Cloud Orchestration: Automate provisioning and day 2 actions
│   ├── Continuous Optimization: Automatically pinpoint and remediate cloud waste
│   ├── Hybrid Cloud Governance: Deploy policies that govern your cloud resources
│   ├── Reselling and Distribution: Automated billing and margin management
│   └── Kubernetes Optimization
└── Why CloudBolt (Build, Manage, Optimize story)
```


## Timeline & What We Need

Here's where we stand and what's coming next:

### **Next Week (July 14-18)**
- Homepage copy finalized - let me know if you want to review before we lock it
- All solution "Hero" pages copy signed off
- Navigation structure confirmed
- Agency estimates back ("Good, Better, Best" options - I'll share the numbers)
- **ExComm + ELT presentation** with mockups 

### **July 31st Deadline** _(Going Live)_
- Hero pages, Persona pages, Capability pages
- Homepage V1 (copy updates only - the big visual changes come later)
- New navigation structure
- Interactive sections storyboarded and copy finalized

### **August 21st** _(Enhanced Features)_
- All in-house graphics completed
- Demo/trial/marketplace buttons deployed across pages
- Zinger videos and StoryLane demos integrated

### **TBD - Phase 2** _(The Big Stuff)_
- Interactive homepage form
- Major visual overhaul
- Interactive graphic rails

_Timeline for Phase 2 depends on agency capacity and budget approval - we could either accelerate this or push to Q4 depending on priorities._

## Help needed
**Internal Team**: Marketing team will handle content, copy, and basic design elements 
**Broader Leadership**: Feedback and key working sessions for use-case, capability, and persona planning
**External Agency**: Required for site architecture changes and advanced interactive features  
**Budget Consideration**: We are planning a call with our agency to scope "Good, Better, Best" project for timelines and cost  

---
## Bottom Line

This revitalization positions us to better serve our diverse customer base while driving measurable improvements in lead generation. The team's done excellent work this week, and I'm confident in our plan.

Questions? I'm happy to discuss on Slack.

## Quick Context

I wanted to share a readout from our marketing team's intensive week on the website revitalization project. The team put in significant hours and frankly, accomplished what I'd typically budget 3-4 weeks to complete. We went from analysis to strategy to actual content drafting - and I'm impressed with what we pulled together.

Let me walk you through what we're building, the timeline we're working toward, and where I think we need some decisions from leadership.

## What We're Solving For

Our current website has a fundamental problem: our personas can't easily find what they're looking for. We're asking potential customers to burn too many mental calories just to understand what we do. That needs to change.

Here's how we're approaching this:

### **1. Persona-Driven Navigation That Actually Works**

Right now, our site is essentially a "junk drawer" - everything's there, but good luck finding it quickly. We're redesigning around four core go-to-market motions:

- Cloud Management
- Kubernetes Rightsizing
- Cloud Reselling
- Cloud FinOps

**The test**: Can each persona find their solution in under 30 seconds? If not, we're not done.

### **2. Conversion-Forward Throughout**

I'm concerned about our current conversion rates, so we're putting CTAs everywhere they make sense:

- Interactive homepage form (following what nOps and CloudZero are doing)
- "Book a Demo" buttons on every page - no exceptions
- StormForge pages get free trial + AWS Marketplace buttons

**Target**: 25% lift in qualified leads. We could aim higher, but I'd rather under-promise here.

### **3. StormForge Brand Clarity**

We need to better represent StormForge both as a standalone product and as part of our broader Cloud FinOps story. We're adding Kubernetes Rightsizing as its own solution on the homepage and pulling the best copy from their existing product pages.

### **4. Visual Storytelling That Shows, Doesn't Tell**

## What I Need From Leadership

**Budget Clarity**: Once we get agency estimates, I'll need quick turnaround on scope approval. Some of this can be done in-house, but the major architecture changes require external help.

**Content Review Process**: We're moving fast on copy - do we want a formal review cycle or should I proceed with marketing team sign-off?

**Priority Question**: Should we prioritize speed to market (July 31st launch) or hold for the full visual experience? I'm leaning toward the phased approach, but want alignment.

---

## Bottom Line

This revitalization positions us to better serve our diverse customer base while driving measurable improvements in lead generation. The team's done excellent work this week, and I'm confident in our execution plan.

**Next step**: Let me know when you want to see the mockups - I think you'll be impressed with the direction.

Questions? I'm happy to dive deeper on any of this.
