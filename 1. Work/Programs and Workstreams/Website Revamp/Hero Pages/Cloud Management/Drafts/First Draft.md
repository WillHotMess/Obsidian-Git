## **A Modern Cloud Experience, Everywhere**

Your competitive alternative isn't another tool—it's the chaos of manual request fulfillment, sprawling spreadsheets, and the slow, error-prone delivery that can’t keep up with business demands1. CloudBolt is designed to replace that complexity with speed and control.

Eyebrow: IT & Service Automation

## **Deliver IT Services at the Speed of a Click**

Eliminate the IT bottleneck and empower your development teams with on-demand access to the resources they need. Instead of waiting days for infrastructure, your teams can use a self-service catalog to instantly deploy everything from a single VM to complex, multi-tier application stacks in minutes1.

- **Self-Service Catalog:** Provide on-demand, controlled access to infrastructure, applications, and automated workflows, freeing up your central IT team to focus on high-value initiatives1.
    
- **Automated Service Blueprints:** Go beyond basic templates. Codify costs, security, and compliance into "governance-by-design" patterns that ensure every deployment is consistent, secure, and repeatable. 
    
- **IaC Management:** Seamlessly import, manage, and expose your existing Terraform, CloudFormation, and other IaC configurations through the self-service catalog1.

Eyebrow: Security & Governance

## **Govern Your Entire Hybrid Footprint with Confidence**

Gain a single source of truth for all your IT assets, no matter where they live. CloudBolt gives you the visibility to eliminate shadow IT and the power to enforce policies automatically, ensuring every resource remains compliant from deployment to decommissioning1.

- **Auto-Discovery and Drift Management:** Continuously scan your networks to identify all resources and track any changes made outside of approved processes, giving you a complete and accurate inventory1.
    
- **Day-Two Operations Management:** Empower users with the access they need, while ensuring they can only perform actions governed by role-based policies. Reconfigure resources, install software, and run maintenance tasks securely1.
    
- **Built-in Approval Frameworks:** Easily map your organization's hierarchy and service requirements to automated approval workflows, ensuring financial and security guardrails are always enforced1.

## **Integrate Everything, Automate Anything**

Your tech stack is unique. Your management platform should be, too. CloudBolt was built on a flexible, Python-based architecture, giving you the power to connect your existing systems and tailor the platform to your specific operational needs without vendor lock-in1.

- **Extensible Plugin Architecture:** Leverage a library of over 200 pre-built integrations for leading public clouds, private cloud technologies, and IT operations tools like ServiceNow, Veeam, and Infoblox1.
    
- **Actions as Code:** Treat your automation as code. Develop, test, and promote orchestration workflows through your source control systems for more reliable and scalable automation2.
    
- **Python-Based Platform:** Tap into the language of automation. Your team can easily create custom integrations and workflows, extending the platform to meet any business requirement1.
