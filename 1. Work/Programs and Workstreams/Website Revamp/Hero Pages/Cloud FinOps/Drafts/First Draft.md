**Eyebrow:** Cost Allocation That Works
## Achieve 99% allocation accuracy without the manual tagging nightmare

Finally solve the cost allocation problem with our FOCUS-native platform that automatically normalizes tags, discovers relationships, and allocates costs across AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, and Kubernetes. Even allocate unused Kubernetes capacity at the workload level to drive true accountability. Get allocation "off the table" in weeks, not months.

# Frequently asked questions

**How does your AI-driven anomaly detection work?** Our ML engine trains on your last 60 days of cost data, learning your unique patterns including seasonality and business cycles. It automatically flags deviations at the provider, account, and service level—then can trigger automated responses like notifications, tagging, or even resource actions.

**What makes your cost allocation different?** We're the first platform rebuilt from the ground up on the FOCUS standard. Our agent normalizes data from any source—VMware, Kubernetes, SaaS—into one unified model. Combined with automatic tag normalization and relationship discovery, we achieve 99% allocation accuracy without months of manual work.

**What's continuous optimization vs. traditional recommendations?** Traditional tools generate static lists of recommendations that pile up in backlogs. Our continuous optimization runs 24/7, automatically detecting and remediating waste based on your policies. It's the difference between a report that says "you could save money" and a system that actually saves it for you.

**How are your KPIs different from standard cost metrics?** Our KPIs measure outcomes, not activities. The FinOps Performance Index (FPI) is a composite score of what actually matters: how much waste you've eliminated (Optimization Score), how well-governed your spend is (Cost Health), and how fast you turn insights into action. These drive behavior change, not just awareness.

**Do you support private cloud and VMware?** Yes. Our CloudBolt Agent provides the same FinOps capabilities for VMware, Nutanix, and OpenStack that you get for public clouds—all normalized through FOCUS for true unified visibility.
