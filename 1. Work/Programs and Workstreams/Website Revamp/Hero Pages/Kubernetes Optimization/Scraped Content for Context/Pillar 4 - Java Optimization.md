## Product Overview

**Product name:** StormForge Java Heap Optimization

**Product Description:** StormForge Java Heap Optimization is a specialized solution that optimizes both Java heap sizes and container resources simultaneously. While traditional Kubernetes optimization tools only adjust container-level settings, StormForge collects JVM-specific metrics to provide precise recommendations that ensure optimal performance and resource efficiency for Java applications running in Kubernetes environments.

**Key features:**

- Collection of deep JVM metrics (heap usage, non-heap usage, garbage collection)
    
- Intelligent Java heap size recommendations based on resource behavior
    
- Coordinated container requests and limits optimization
    
- Automated deployment of recommendations
    

**Unique selling proposition (USP):** The only solution that holistically optimizes both Java heap sizes and container resources, eliminating OOMKills and excessive garbage collection while reducing resource waste and operational toil.

**Launch date:** Generally available as of April 1, 2025

## Problem Statement

**Clearly define the problem:** Kubernetes and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) operate with fundamentally different memory management models. While Kubernetes enforces a single memory limit on the entire container process, the JVM divides memory into multiple distinct regions (heap and non-heap). Standard Kubernetes optimization tools that only adjust container requests and limits often cause Java applications to experience OOMKills (Exit Code 137) or performance degradation from excessive garbage collection, while manual tuning requires specialized knowledge and becomes unsustainable at scale.

**Explain why this problem needs solving:** This problem creates significant operational challenges:

1. Resource wastage and inflated cloud costs from over-provisioning to avoid stability issues
    
2. Unsustainable operational toil when manually tuning numerous Java microservices
    
3. Inability to use standard Kubernetes optimization tools for Java workloads
    
4. Application instability from unexpected OOMKills even when Java heap usage appears normal
    
    1. I do want to point out to users that applications change over time as you add features, the perf characteristics change… so a recent code deploy could increase your heap usage and cause you ooms. But we’re always watching so if that happens we can come in and increase your heap before you have an issue.
        
5. Performance degradation from excessive garbage collection affecting user experience and SLAs

## Target Audience

**Describe target user/customer:** The primary users of StormForge Java Heap Optimization are platform engineering teams, SREs (Site Reliability Engineers), and DevOps professionals responsible for running and optimizing Java applications on Kubernetes. These technical professionals are tasked with ensuring application stability and performance while controlling infrastructure costs, especially in organizations using microservice architectures with numerous Java services.

**Include user personas:**

1. **Platform Engineer** - Responsible for building and maintaining the Kubernetes platform that development teams deploy to. Constantly balancing infrastructure cost optimization with providing enough resources for stable application performance.
    
2. **SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)** - Focuses on system reliability and performance. Gets paged when applications crash with OOMKills and must troubleshoot JVM memory issues while ensuring service level objectives (SLOs) are met.
    
3. **DevOps Engineer** - Works at the intersection of development and operations, helping to automate deployment pipelines and optimize application configurations. Needs to efficiently manage resource utilization without deep JVM expertise.
    
4. **FinOps Practitioner** - Responsible for cloud cost optimization and identifying waste. Looks for opportunities to right-size resources without sacrificing performance or reliability.
