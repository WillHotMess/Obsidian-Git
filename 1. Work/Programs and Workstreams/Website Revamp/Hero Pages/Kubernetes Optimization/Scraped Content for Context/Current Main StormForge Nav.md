## Maximize efficiency and ensure performance with bi-dimensional autoscaling

Unlike basic vertical autoscaling approaches (such as VPA) that conflict with Kubernetes’ built-in Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Optimize Live uses a **forecast-based machine learning algorithm** to continuously harmonize CPU and memory resource requests and limits with standard HPA utilization targets, giving you the best of both worlds:

1. **HORIZONTAL** pod autoscaling replicates pods in seconds, ensuring performance when faced with a sharp spike in demand.
2. **VERTICAL** pod autoscaling continuously aligns resources to application demand as utilization ebbs and flows over hours, days and weeks.

## Rightsize Accurately

Applications perform reliably and cost effectively — even under fluctuating demand — with infrastructure that is optimally scaled using an advanced workload [forecasting machine learning algorithm](https://www.stormforge.io/blog/machine-learning-improve-rightsizing-recommendations-noisy-seasonal-workloads/), which analyzes seasonal trends to recommend optimal resource configurations.

This goes far beyond basic statistical approaches. A fine-grained understanding of each new workload’s demand patterns is built in just a few days with resource utilization analyzed every 15 seconds.

## Preview Impact to Gain Trust

Seeing is believing. Compare how the recommendations would perform against your current settings, including resource consumption, utilization, and estimated cost savings.

## Simplify at Scale

### **Intelligent Enough to Plug-And-Play**

Begin optimizing clusters in minutes with automatic discovery, machine learning analysis, and reliable recommendations ready to deploy in a week.

No human configuration or tuning required.

### **Autonomous at Enterprise Scale**

Put estate-wide rightsizing on autopilot with hands-free lifecycle automation. Optimize Live automatically discovers each new pod, captures its metrics, learns its patterns, calculates optimum settings, and applies them.

After investing 2 minutes in onboarding a cluster, no further manual steps are required.

### **Tuning Optional**

Tailor optimization for specific workloads that are business-critical or outliers:

- Select an optimization goal for extra reliability or savings
- Specify resizing frequency
- Set min/max requests
- Include or exclude resource settings such as limits
- And other guardrails as needed

### **Integrates with Your GitOps Workflow**

Ensure recommendations are always enforced alongside Argo or Flux.  No need to change your manifests or pipelines — unless you want to.

### **Unify Visibility and Control**

See all your workloads in one place. Track resource savings and opportunities across clusters, namespaces, and workloads.
