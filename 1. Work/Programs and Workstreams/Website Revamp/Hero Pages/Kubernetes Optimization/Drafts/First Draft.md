# Built for the reality of production Kubernetes

**Eyebrow:** Eliminate Manual Toil

## Stop setting CPU and memory requests manually

Your developers shouldn't be infrastructure economists, and your platform team shouldn't spend their time tuning resource configs for hundreds of workloads. Our forecast-based machine learning analyzes utilization patterns every 15 seconds to automatically rightsize resources as demand fluctuates — from daily traffic spikes to seasonal trends.

**Eyebrow:** Prevent Performance Issues

## Get rightsizing that accounts for real workload behavior

Unlike basic VPA approaches that conflict with your HPA, our bi-dimensional autoscaling harmonizes vertical and horizontal scaling. We analyze your HPA patterns and adjust both resource requests AND utilization targets, so you get cost efficiency without CPU throttling or OOMKills.

**Eyebrow:** Java Applications

## Finally, rightsizing that understands the JVM

Stop getting OOMKilled Java containers even when heap usage looks fine. We're the only solution that optimizes both JVM heap sizes and container resources together, eliminating the mismatch between Kubernetes memory limits and Java memory management that breaks standard rightsizing tools.

**Eyebrow:** Enterprise Scale

## Deploy across your entire Kubernetes estate without breaking things

Proven across environments with thousands of clusters and hundreds of thousands of workloads. Automatic discovery finds every pod, learns its patterns in days, and applies recommendations with guardrails you control. Integrates with your GitOps workflow — no pipeline changes required.

# What makes autonomous rightsizing possible

**Forecast-based Machine Learning:** Analyzes seasonal trends and HPA behavior to predict resource needs, not just react to past usage

**Bi-dimensional Optimization:** Harmonizes vertical pod autoscaling with horizontal scaling instead of fighting against it

**JVM-Aware Optimization:** Collects deep JVM metrics and optimizes both Java heap sizes and container resources to eliminate OOMKills and excessive garbage collection

**Production-Grade Automation:** Automatically discovers workloads, learns patterns, and applies recommendations with configurable guardrails

**GitOps Integration:** Deploys recommendations through your existing workflows — patches, manifests, or automation

**Enterprise Visibility:** Unified view of optimization opportunities and savings across clusters, namespaces, and workloads

# Frequently asked questions

**Q: How does this work with our existing HPA and cluster autoscaling?** A: We're designed to enhance, not replace your existing autoscaling. Our recommendations work with HPA, KEDA, and Karpenter to optimize the full autoscaling stack.

**Q: Do you handle Java applications differently?** A: Yes. We collect JVM-specific metrics (heap usage, GC patterns) and optimize both Java heap sizes and container resources together. This prevents the OOMKills that standard Kubernetes rightsizing tools cause with Java workloads.

**Q: What if we have custom workloads or unusual traffic patterns?** A: Our ML algorithms handle noisy, seasonal, and unpredictable workloads. You can set custom optimization goals, guardrails, and exclusions for business-critical applications.

**Q: How do we ensure this won't impact application performance?** A: Every recommendation includes impact preview showing resource consumption, utilization, and estimated savings before deployment. You control rollout speed and can set safety thresholds.

## Why Engineering Leaders Choose CloudBolt

**✓ 90% faster time-to-savings**  
Reduce the time from insight to action from months to hours. For organizations managing thousands of applications, manual sizing is impractical. Continuous automation enables dynamic adjustments (e.g., scaling up during peak traffic, downsizing during off-peak) to realize immediate savings.

**✓ Reduced manual work**  
Eliminate repetitive tuning of resource configurations. Platform teams handling large-scale environments recognize that "manually sizing workloads based on unpredictable usage is unsustainable." Our AI-driven automation handles this, freeing teams to focus on strategic improvements.

**✓ 40-60% Kubernetes savings**  
Achieve predictable cost reductions through automated container optimization. Organizations typically see savings by right-sizing workloads to actual demand, reducing node footprints while maintaining performance.

**✓ 99% allocation accuracy**  
Maximize node efficiency by aligning resource requests with real usage. This avoids both overprovisioning (wasted spend) and underprovisioning (performance risks). Teams achieve high utilization rates (e.g., 80% node capacity) without sacrificing reliability.
