## Demo 1: Gain Complete Kubernetes Visibility
**Screen 1: The Hidden Cost of Kubernetes** Kubernetes has driven up cloud spend for 49% of organizations, with 70% citing overprovisioning as the primary cause. CloudBolt + StormForge breaks open this "black box" of container spending. [Begin Tour]
**Screen 2: Cluster Dashboard** See your entire Kubernetes environment at a glance. This cluster is currently costing $205 more than necessary. [Click to expand]
**Screen 3: Detailed Resource Analysis** Notice how many workloads are over-provisioned, wasting valuable resources. But there's also a critical insight here - some workloads are under-provisioned, creating performance risks. [Next]
**Screen 4: Workload Deep Dive** Zoom in on specific workloads to see precisely where optimization can occur. This frontend service has memory requests far above actual usage, creating substantial waste. [Next]
**Screen 5: Usage Patterns Over Time** Our platform captures historical usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities that manual analysis would miss. This time-series view reveals consistent overprovisioning. [Next]
**Screen 6: Multi-Dimensional Reporting** Break down costs by namespace, workload, team, or application to align spending with business priorities. Accountability starts with visibility. [Next]
**Screen 7: From Insight to Action** Unlike tools that only provide visibility, CloudBolt + StormForge automatically generates optimization recommendations based on real usage patterns. [Next]
**Screen 8: Realize the Savings** This cluster alone shows $296 in potential monthly savings - multiply that across your entire Kubernetes estate for transformative cost reduction. [See how we optimize →]

## Demo 2: Automate Resource Optimization
**Screen 1: The Optimization Challenge** Manual Kubernetes tuning is time-consuming, error-prone, and unsustainable at scale. Our platform automates this process with machine learning. [Begin Tour]
**Screen 2: ML-Driven Recommendations** Our machine learning engine analyzes actual workload patterns to generate precise recommendations tailored to your applications. [View recommendations]
**Screen 3: Recommendation Details** For this frontend service, we've identified the optimal resource settings based on historical usage patterns. Note how we're optimizing both CPU and memory resources. [Next]
**Screen 4: HPA Integration** We seamlessly integrate with Horizontal Pod Autoscalers, adjusting target utilization to maintain consistent scaling behavior after right-sizing. [Next]
**Screen 5: Validation & Verification** Engineers can review and verify recommendations before implementation, with clear explanations of the reasoning behind each suggestion. [Next]
**Screen 6: Multiple Implementation Options** Choose your preferred implementation method: one-click application, kubectl patch, or integration with your GitOps workflow. [Next]
**Screen 7: Continuous Optimization** Unlike static approaches, our system continuously adapts to changing workload patterns, ensuring sustained efficiency over time. [Next]
**Screen 8: Impact Analysis** Track the real-world impact of optimizations on both cost and performance metrics, with clear before-and-after comparisons. [See how we set guardrails →]

## Demo 3: Configure Guardrails & Settings
**Screen 1: Control with Confidence** Automated optimization requires trust. Our guardrails ensure that efficiency never comes at the expense of reliability. [Begin Tour]
**Screen 2: Optimization Goals** Adjust the balance between cost savings and reliability to align with each environment's requirements. Production workloads typically prioritize reliability over maximum savings. [Next]
**Screen 3: Deployment Thresholds** Prevent unnecessary churn by setting thresholds for minimum change sizes, ensuring we only apply meaningful optimizations. [Next]
**Screen 4: Resource Boundaries** Set minimum and maximum resource limits to ensure applications always have what they need, even during unexpected traffic spikes. [Next]
**Screen 5: Multi-Level Configuration** Apply settings at cluster, namespace, or workload levels for granular control within a consistent framework. [Next]
**Screen 6: Developer-Friendly Annotations** Use familiar Kubernetes annotations to configure optimization behavior, integrating seamlessly with existing workflows. [Next]
**Screen 7: Dry Run Testing** Validate optimization strategies in a risk-free mode before full implementation to build confidence in the approach. [Next]
**Screen 8: Automated Deployment Settings** Configure when and how often optimizations are applied to match your deployment and maintenance schedules. [See the complete solution →]

## Demo 4: Close the FinOps Loop
**Screen 1: The Insight-to-Action Gap** Most tools stop at providing information, leaving engineering teams to manually implement changes. CloudBolt + StormForge closes this loop. [Begin Tour]
**Screen 2: The Complete Workflow** Our integrated platform creates a seamless process from visibility to optimization, eliminating manual handoffs between tools. [Next]
**Screen 3: Deploy & Discover** A lightweight agent analyzes your clusters, collecting resource utilization and cost data with minimal overhead. [Next]
**Screen 4: Analyze & Visualize** Our platform processes this data to provide comprehensive visibility into costs and resource usage patterns. [Next]
**Screen 5: Optimize & Automate** Machine learning algorithms automatically identify and implement optimization opportunities according to your policies. [Next]
**Screen 6: Measure & Refine** The system continuously measures optimization impact and refines its approach based on real-world results. [Next]
**Screen 7: Real-World Impact** Customers typically see 40-70% reduction in Kubernetes costs while improving application reliability and freeing engineering time. [Next]
**Screen 8: Get Started Today** Experience the future of Kubernetes cost management with CloudBolt + StormForge. [Book a Demo] [Start Free Trial]
