Subject: LAUNCHED TODAY: StormForge Free Trial Nurture Campaign - Enhancing Product-Led Growth

Dear Leadership Team,

I'm excited to announce that our long-anticipated StormForge free trial nurture campaign is now live! This represents a significant milestone in our effort to bolster StormForge's product-led growth strategy and increase conversion rates from trial to paid customers.

## Background & Goals

As many of you know, enhancing our trial user conversion has been a longstanding goal for the StormForge team. Previously, users received only a welcome email and trial expiration notification, leaving a significant gap in our ability to guide and convert these potential customers. Our goals with this implementation are to:
1. Increase installation rates for trial signups
2. Convert more "ghost contacts" (Gmail users) into qualified business leads
3. Create clear pathways to commercialization
4. Provide timely, relevant guidance to users at each stage of their trial journey

## Implementation Overview
The nurture campaign features two distinct user paths:
**Path A: For Users Who Sign Up But Don't Install**
**Path B: For Users Who Complete Installation**

Each email contains strategic CTAs directing users to either:
1. Purchase via AWS Marketplace (Pay-Go option)
2. Schedule a consultation with Josh Sides (early emails focus on product guidance; later emails on enterprise sales)

## Lead Qualification Process
A key focus of this process is how we handle "ghost contacts." When users click to schedule a meeting, they're directed to a form requiring a business email address, converting anonymous Gmail users into qualified leads. The system maintains the connection between the ghost contact and the business identity through tenant ID, preserving all trial activity data.

Once the form is completed, users are immediately presented with Josh's calendar to book a 30-minute slot, creating a seamless path to engagement.

## Acknowledgments

This implementation represents a true cross-functional effort, and I'd like to specifically thank:

- Yasmin for her product expertise and content guidance
- Nick Walker for his collaboration on email content development
- Joanne Chu for her exceptional work refining our messaging and nurture strategy
- Nick Macaione for his invaluable support with the Salesforce migration and sales operations architecture

## What's Next

We'll be closely monitoring the performance of this campaign, tracking metrics such as:
- Installation conversion rates
- Meeting bookings with Josh
- AWS Marketplace conversions
- Overall trial-to-paid conversion rate

I welcome your feedback and questions as we continue to refine this approach. With this foundation in place, we're well-positioned to enhance our product-led growth motion and drive increased revenue from our trial program.

Best regards,

William Norton
