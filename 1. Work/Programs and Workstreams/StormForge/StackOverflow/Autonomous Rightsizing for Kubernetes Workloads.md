Optimize Live
Autonomous Rightsizing for Kubernetes Workloads
Horizontal Autoscaling PERFORMANCE with Vertical Autoscaling EFFICIENCY

Start A Trial

Maximize efficiency and ensure performance with bi-dimensional autoscaling
Unlike basic vertical autoscaling approaches (such as VPA) that conflict with Kubernetes’ built-in Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), Optimize Live uses a forecast-based machine learning algorithm to continuously harmonize CPU and memory resource requests and limits with standard HPA utilization targets, giving you the best of both worlds:

HORIZONTAL pod autoscaling replicates pods in seconds, ensuring performance when faced with a sharp spike in demand.
VERTICAL pod autoscaling continuously aligns resources to application demand as utilization ebbs and flows over hours, days and weeks.

Rightsize Accurately
Applications perform reliably and cost effectively — even under fluctuating demand — with infrastructure that is optimally scaled using an advanced workload forecasting machine learning algorithm, which analyzes seasonal trends to recommend optimal resource configurations.

This goes far beyond basic statistical approaches. A fine-grained understanding of each new workload’s demand patterns is built in just a few days with resource utilization analyzed every 15 seconds.

Simplify at Scale
Intelligent Enough to Plug-And-Play
Begin optimizing clusters in minutes with automatic discovery, machine learning analysis, and reliable recommendations ready to deploy in a week.

No human configuration or tuning required.

Autonomous at Enterprise Scale
Put estate-wide rightsizing on autopilot with hands-free lifecycle automation. Optimize Live automatically discovers each new pod, captures its metrics, learns its patterns, calculates optimum settings, and applies them.

After investing 2 minutes in onboarding a cluster, no further manual steps are required.

Tuning Optional
Tailor optimization for specific workloads that are business-critical or outliers:

Select an optimization goal for extra reliability or savings
Specify resizing frequency
Set min/max requests
Include or exclude resource settings such as limits
And other guardrails as needed
