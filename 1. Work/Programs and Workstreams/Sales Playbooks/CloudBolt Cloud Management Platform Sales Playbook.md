Our platform transforms your data center into a modern, efficient operation that delivers self-service capabilities, enforces governance, and optimizes costsâ€”all while maintaining the control and security your enterprise demands.

Unlike traditional infrastructure management approaches that create silos and require extensive manual effort, CloudBolt brings hybrid, mixed environments into a single pane of glass. We do this without costly integration efforts, offering a powerful, unified cloud experience on any infrastructure, for any technology stack, and we back it all up with enterprise-grade support.

CloudBolt enables you to drive digital transformation in your organization, while empowering your developers, streamlining operations, and reducing overall data center and cloud costs.

### 1.2 Company Background

Founded by engineers who understood the complexity of modern infrastructure management, CloudBolt was built on a simple yet powerful premise: enterprises need the agility and automation of public cloud for their entire infrastructure portfolio, not just their cloud workloads.

CloudBolt has evolved from solving basic provisioning challenges to becoming a comprehensive cloud management platform that addresses the full lifecycle of infrastructure management. Our customers have proven that private cloud doesn't have to be complex, expensive, or limiting.

With CloudBolt, organizations achieve:
- 800% faster service delivery
- 99% reduction in manual tasks
- 70% reduction in infrastructure costs
- Complete visibility and control across hybrid environments

### 2.1 Today's IT Landscape vs the Legacy

|Paradigm|Legacy|The New Cloud (Private, Public or Hybrid)|
|---|---|---|
|**Overview**|Manual processes, siloed teams, reactive management|Automated, integrated, proactive operations|
|**Data-center infra**|Physical servers, traditional virtualization, manual provisioning|Software-defined infrastructure, automated provisioning, cloud-native|
|**Service delivery**|Ticket-based, weeks to provision, manual handoffs|Self-service portals, minutes to provision, automated workflows|
|**Governance**|After-the-fact audits, manual compliance checks|Policy-driven automation, built-in compliance, continuous monitoring|
|**Cost management**|Reactive, limited visibility, departmental budgets|Proactive optimization, full transparency, chargeback/showback|
|**Innovation**|Slow adoption of new technologies, risk-averse|Rapid experimentation, fail-fast mentality, continuous improvement|

### 2.2 Ideal Customer Profile

Any Fortune 10000 Enterprise operating in an industry vertical (e.g. financial services, retail, insurance, media & entertainment, telco, ecommerce) will immensely benefit from CloudBolt. 

Here are the six key conditions:

1. **300+ physical servers** in data centers, colos, or edge locations
2. **Operational challenges** with current infrastructure management (low utilization <30%, no centralized resource pooling, manual operations)
3. **100+ developers** requiring self-service, DevOps-centric experiences
