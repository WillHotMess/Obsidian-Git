## Summary

This appears to be the conclusion of a larger meeting focused on improving CloudBolt's demo strategy and addressing Q3 business impact concerns. The discussion centered on refining the company's approach to product demonstrations to be more targeted and customer-focused rather than showcasing all capabilities broadly.

## Agenda

_Based on available transcript fragment:_

- Demo strategy refinement discussion
- Q3 impact planning and Rev OPS alignment
- Transition planning to transparency meeting

## Discussion Notes

### Demo Strategy Optimization

**Key Challenge Identified**: Current demos tend to be too broad in scope

- Steve Francis noted that current demo approach shows "everything we can do" rather than focusing on specific customer needs
- Recommendation to be more diagnostic in approach: identify key areas where prospects need help, then focus demonstrations on those specific areas
- Goal is to "leave them wanting more" rather than overwhelming with full feature set
- Peter was acknowledged as having "great instincts" but could benefit from more targeted approach

### Demo Process Improvement Areas

- Need better discovery/diagnosis before demo delivery
- Focus on prospect's specific pain points rather than comprehensive feature overview
- Strategic approach to create desire for additional engagement rather than information overload

### Q3 Business Impact

- Reference made to previous Rev OPS call where Q3 impact was discussed
- Brendan (not present in this segment) was noted as being "emphatic about the Q3 impact"
- Mark clarified he was steering conversation toward Q3 impact based on this previous discussion

### Meeting Transitions

- Multiple team members were transitioning to another meeting focused on "transparency"
- Steve Francis was confirmed as joining the follow-up transparency discussion

## Action Items

- [ ] **Steve Francis & Peter**: Implement more targeted demo approach focusing on prospect-specific needs rather than comprehensive feature overview
- [ ] **Demo Team**: Develop better discovery process to diagnose key prospect pain points before demo delivery
- [ ] **Follow-up**: Continue Q3 impact discussion in appropriate Rev OPS context
- [ ] **Team**: Proceed with transparency meeting as scheduled
