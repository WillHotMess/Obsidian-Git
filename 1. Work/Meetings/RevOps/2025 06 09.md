## Discussion Notes

### Pipeline Performance Overview

- **Current Status**: 114 total opportunities, $10.2M in outstanding pipeline
- **Target Achievement**: 118% to revised target of $2.7M (currently at $3.2M)
- **Stage Distribution**: Discovery (~$3M), Prove (~$2M), Qualification (~$1.7M)
- **Zero-Dollar Opportunities**: 16 opportunities with no value assigned, representing potential $1.2M additional pipeline

### StormForge Product Challenges

- **Current ASP Issues**: New business averaging $48K, upsell at $73K (significantly below projected $110K ASP)
- **Pipeline Impact**: 24% of opportunities (29 out of 114) are StormForge-related
- **Marketing Spend**: $192K allocated for remainder of year, plus $44K MDF for Learning Kubernetes initiative
- **ROI Concerns**: Questions raised about sustainability of marketing spend vs. revenue generation potential

### Revenue Target Reality Check

- **Q4 Target**: $325K StormForge revenue required
- **Annual Run Rate**: $1.4M needed to justify current investment
- **Challenge**: Achieving targets with current $48K ASP requires significantly higher volume than current capacity

### Marketing & Lead Generation Strategy

- **Current Approach**: Multi-channel strategy including ads, ABM, LinkedIn, Reddit, AWS partnerships
- **ICP Discussion**: Debate over targeting platform engineers vs. FinOps personas
- **Message Differentiation**: Need for reliability messaging to engineers vs. cost savings to FinOps teams

### Revenue Levers & Partner Strategy

#### Immediate Q3 Focus Areas:

1. **RapidScale Onboarding**: Potential $250K ARR if $25M cloud spend onboarded
2. **NordCloud MSP Deal**: Pricing model alignment needed, executive re-engagement scheduled
3. **Ingram Partner Channel**: Need structured approach to identify billing-dissatisfied customers
4. **Kubernetes Cross-sell**: 37 existing customer opportunities requiring sales enablement focus

#### Strategic Challenges:

- **Ingram Partners**: Lack of clear strategy for engaging partner sales org structure
- **Cross-sell Execution**: Limited field sales capability to sell StormForge intelligently
- **Timeline Pressure**: 90-day window for Q3 impact requires immediate action

### Product Integration & Cross-sell Strategy

- **Current Gap**: Limited evidence of combined CMP + StormForge sales plays in pipeline
- **Opportunity**: $48K StormForge + $100K CMP = $148K combined deal above ASP targets
- **Challenge**: Sales organization not effectively positioning multi-product solutions

## Action Items

- [ ] **Will Norton**: Develop separate ASP tracking and pipeline targets by product/use case to improve reporting accuracy
- [ ] **Kyle Campos**: Lead RapidScale onboarding meeting (scheduled Wednesday) and report back on $25M cloud spend potential
- [ ] **Kyle Campos**: Insert himself into NordCloud opportunity and coordinate with upcoming Thursday executive meeting

## Follow-up

    - StormForge marketing budget review needed
    - Sales enablement plan for multi-product positioning

## Key Decisions Made

1. **ASP Strategy**: Agreed to lower StormForge ASP expectations from $110K to ~$50K for new business planning
2. **Revenue Focus**: Prioritize RapidScale and NordCloud as most actionable Q3 revenue levers
3. **Partner Approach**: Shift Ingram strategy from "wait for them to sell" to "identify specific unhappy customers"
4. **Resource Allocation**: Kyle Campos to drive RapidScale and NordCloud initiatives directly
5. **Reporting Changes**: Implement product-specific pipeline tracking to improve forecasting accuracy
