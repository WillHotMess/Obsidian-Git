# FinOps platform evaluation with Transparency for cloud billing optimization

Fri, 13 Jun 25

### Their background

- Transparity - a fast-growing MSP focusing exclusively on Microsoft solutions
- Currently have 310 CSP customers, only 25-30% are managed service customers
- Running Microsoft stack internally (Dynamics, Business Central, Dynamic CRM)
- CSP spend breakdown: 50% Azure, 50% licensing with 10-15% marketplace spend within Azure portion
- Currently using Spectra C3 for billing automation
- Robert reports to CTO at Transparity

### Pain points and needs
- Current FinOps reporting is “embarrassing” and “very basic” - just raw data without context or recommendations
- Manual processes: “expensive consultants spending lots of time updating spreadsheets”
- Disconnected billing: separate invoices for consumption/licensing vs professional services
- Financial reporting challenges: “our finance team tearing their hair out trying to get actual [figures]”
- Need granular control over customer access to match service tiers
- Currently “hand cranked” with “no tooling” beyond native tools and Excel
- Looking to modernize services and improve customer value proposition

### Questions or concerns
- Need ability to control what different customer types can see/access
- Integration capabilities with Dynamics Business Central
- Accessibility of data for broader sales teams
- Questions about billing operations functionality compared to Work365

Quoted pricing:
- Cloud Bolt FinOps Platform: $393,000 (from $660,000 list)
- Bill Ops for Office 365: $196,500 (from $393,000)
- Total: $589,500 ($49,125/month)
- Based on $32.75M USD spend
    

Timeline:
- Completing business case by end of month/early July
