- "You mentioned evaluating FinOut and Vantage - what specifically attracted you to those platforms, and where are they falling short of your requirements?"
- "What's driving the urgency to replace KubeCost and explore new solutions and do you have a timeline for having a new solution in place?"
- "Are you looking to solve this incrementally or do you have budget approval for a comprehensive platform approach?"
- "Beyond this group, who else needs to see measurable value from this investment to consider it successful?"
- "If we could solve your immediate GCP reporting needs in 30 days, what would be the next biggest pain point you'd want to tackle?"


"Thanks for taking the time today, Saurabh and team. I know you're evaluating several FinOps platforms, so I want to make sure we use our time well. Here's what I'd like to cover in the next 45 minutes:

First, I'll recap what we've heard so far, and we would love to understand more about your current environment and the specific challenges you're facing with reporting and manual.

Then, we can jump in to the platform 

And finally, if it makes sense for both sides, we'll discuss specific next steps.

At the end, I'll be direct about whether I think we can help, and you can be direct about your level of interest. 

Does that sound good? Is there anything specific you'd like to make sure we cover?"

# WorkJam Discovery Call Recap & Next Steps

## **Call Summary**

**Date:** Monday follow-up to Friday's initial discussion  
**Attendees:** Saurabh (SRE/FinOps Lead), Remy (K8s team), Frederick (Reliability team), William, Peter, Josh

## **Key Insights from the Call**

**What went well:** 
- **Confirmed Pain Points**: 
	- **Cost transparency and cultural change**: "We want to empower our engineers to look at the tool and understand their cost"
	- Reporting 
	- We are in four different continents" with pricing variations
	- Reporting by customer/feature
	- Moving away from "Excel reports"
- **Platform demonstration**: Successfully showed CloudBolt's FOCUS-based cost reporting and synthetic tagging capabilities
- **StormForge differentiation**: Clearly positioned automation vs. KubeCost's recommendation-only approach
- **Technical engagement**: Remy showed genuine interest in the Java optimization capabilities
- **Timeline identified**: KubeCost renewal deadline end of year creates urgency

### **Where we need to
- **Satisfaction with current optimization**: "We already did optimization using KubeCost and got good results, reduced cloud spend"
- **Limited automation appetite**: More interested in visibility/cultural change than automated optimization
- **Evaluation mode**: "We'll discuss internally and get back within a week" suggests we're still being compared
- **Complex requirements**: Multi-tenant architecture with shared cost allocation needs that weren't fully addressed

### **Core Requirements Confirmed**


## **Critical Next Steps**

### **1. Immediate Credibility Recovery (William - Tomorrow)**

**Email to WorkJam team with:**

#### **Cost Attribution Confidence Statement**

_"After reflecting on our discussion, I want to be crystal clear about our capabilities around customer/region/product attribution. CloudBolt's FOCUS-based platform makes complex cost allocation both powerful and intuitive:_

- _Native support for multi-dimensional cost allocation across customers, regions, and product lines_
- _Synthetic tagging that creates business-friendly cost hierarchies even when underlying GCP tagging is incomplete_
- _Real-time cost attribution that updates every 15 minutes_
- _Business user-friendly dashboards that eliminate the need for Excel-based reporting_

_This isn't a roadmap item - it's core functionality we deliver on day one."_

#### *Derived Unit Economics Value Prop**

_"The power of the FOCUS standard becomes evident when you want to create derived unit cost metrics. Examples we'd love to explore with you:_

- _Cost per customer by geography_
- _Cost per feature utilization across your product suite_
- _Revenue efficiency metrics by customer cohort_
- _Infrastructure cost trends correlated with business growth_

_We'd like to understand what third-party telemetry data you'd want to correlate with cost data to create these business insights."_

#### **Resources to Include**

- Case study of similar multi-tenant SaaS cost allocation
- FOCUS standard explanation document
- Technical overview of synthetic tagging capabilities
- Kubernetes optimization ROI calculator

### **2. Direct Technical Engagement (Josh - This Week)**

**Separate outreach to Remy:**

- _"I'd love to dive deeper into your specific Kubernetes optimization challenges"_
- _"Can we schedule 30 minutes to discuss your current manual processes and how StormForge automation could complement your existing optimization work?"_
- _Offer to run a quick assessment of their cluster efficiency metrics_
- _Position this as technical collaboration, not sales pressure_

### **3. Strategic Positioning Adjustments**

#### **Reframe the Value Proposition**

- **From**: "Replace your current optimization"
- **To**: "Enhance your optimization success with business visibility and cultural adoption"

#### **Emphasize Cultural Change Enablement**

- Position CloudBolt as the platform that makes cost data accessible to engineering teams
- Highlight how FOCUS standardization eliminates the "Excel report" problem
- Show examples of engineering team adoption and engagement
- Prepare specific examples of shared cost allocation models
- Demonstrate how synthetic tagging solves attribution challenges
- Show roadmap for advanced unit economics capabilities

### **4. Competitive Strategy**

**Against FinOut/Vantage:**

- **Kubernetes optimization**: Neither offers StormForge-level automation
- **FOCUS standard**: Position as future-proofing vs. proprietary approaches
- **GCP specialization**: Deeper integration and understanding of Google Cloud cost structures

### **5. Timeline & Follow-Up**

- **Wednesday**: Josh reaches out to Remy for technical deep dive
- **Friday**: Check-in call to address any questions from resources sent
- **Next week**: Expectation management around their internal discussion timeline
- **End of Q3**: Target for decision given KubeCost renewal timing

## **Internal Team Actions**

### **Product Marketing (William)**

- [ ] Create WorkJam-specific case study materials
- [ ] Develop FOCUS value prop specifically for multi-tenant SaaS
- [ ] Prepare derived unit economics examples

### **Technical Team (Josh)**

- [ ] Kubernetes optimization assessment for WorkJam environment
- [ ] Direct technical relationship building with Remy
- [ ] StormForge ROI analysis based on their current cluster metrics

### **Sales Engineering (Peter)**

- [ ] Prepare detailed cost allocation demo scenarios
- [ ] Create synthetic tagging examples for their use cases
- [ ] Develop multi-tenant architecture cost modeling

## **Risk Mitigation**

- **If they're satisfied with current optimization**: Position CloudBolt as enabling the "next phase" of FinOps maturity
- **If they choose competitor**: Maintain relationship for future consideration when requirements evolve
- **If timeline slips**: Keep engagement warm with valuable content and insights

## **Success Metrics**

- Technical engagement from Remy on optimization discussion
- Positive response to cost attribution capabilities
- Commitment to deeper technical evaluation
- Clear timeline for decision with defined next steps



Thanks for the support this afternoon, gents. Not our strongest execution - but we have a better sense of what they are looking for, and I don't think its all that advanced.  With some course correction I am confident we can connect the dots. 

**What we learned:**
- **KubeCost renewal**: End of year (our deadline)
- **Internal decision**: "Discuss internally and get back within a week"
- **Urgency level**: Low - they have time to evaluate properly
- **Current pain**: Excel-based cost reports, no engineering team visibility
- **Priorities**: 
	- **#1 Priority**: Cost visibility and cultural adoption ("empower engineers to look at cost")
	- **#2 Priority**: Multi-tenant cost allocation ("shared cost for certain components")
	- **#3 Priority**: Additional optimization (they're satisfied with current 40% utilization)

**I will send an email tomorrow, with:** 
- Screenshots of customer/region/team attribution reports
- Concrete examples: "Here's exactly what your engineers would see"
- FOCUS benefits
- Roadmap details for derived unit economics
- Offer focused 30-min cost allocation demo only

**Josh is going to directly engage with Remi**
- Java optimization collaboration (not sales pitch)
- Offer cluster free trial
