- "You mentioned evaluating FinOut and Vantage - what specifically attracted you to those platforms, and where are they falling short of your requirements?"
- "What's driving the urgency to replace KubeCost and explore new solutions and do you have a timeline for having a new solution in place?"
- "Are you looking to solve this incrementally or do you have budget approval for a comprehensive platform approach?"
- "Beyond this group, who else needs to see measurable value from this investment to consider it successful?"
- "If we could solve your immediate GCP reporting needs in 30 days, what would be the next biggest pain point you'd want to tackle?"


"Thanks for taking the time today, Saurabh and team. I know you're evaluating several FinOps platforms, so I want to make sure we use our time well. Here's what I'd like to cover in the next 45 minutes:

First, I'll recap what we've heard so far, and we would love to understand more about your current environment and the specific challenges you're facing with reporting and manual.

Then, we can jump in to the platform 

And finally, if it makes sense for both sides, we'll discuss specific next steps.

At the end, I'll be direct about whether I think we can help, and you can be direct about your level of interest. 

Does that sound good? Is there anything specific you'd like to make sure we cover?"
