### Keno’s Background & Role

- New CRO joining to fix sales execution issues
- Previous experience transforming “complete shit shows” - this is the best starting point he’s had
- Four legs transformation model: good product, market fit, talent, execution
    - First three legs already in place at company
    - Execution (his focus) is fixable within his control
- 6-month timeline expected for major improvements
- Coming from Insight company (knows Thomas Crane well)
- Shared history with Rod from influential go-to-market experience
    

### Sales Process & Lead Management Overhaul

- Moving to named accounts model (85% decided)
- Keno wants to be arbiter of all leads going forward
    - More equitable distribution across reps
    - Reward desired behaviors
    - Retention mechanism for top performers like Josh
- Quarterly rep review process with detailed tracking:
    - Meetings completed, sources, performance vs cohort
    - Pipeline movement, new opportunities, stage progression
    - 4x pipeline coverage requirement at stage 3+
    - Deal-by-deal analysis of slips, losses, wins
- Zero tolerance for slow lead response - “notifiable offense"

### Demand Generation Partnership
- Regular cadence planned between Keno, Will, and Nick
- Target pipeline mix: 50% marketing, 25% SDR/BDR, 25% rep-generated
- Keno bringing Insight programs experience:
    - Previous company: $0 to 38% revenue through channel
    - Focus on untapped demand gen sources
- Caleb performing well as lead qualification point
    - Quick 2-hour response time
    - Keno has minor tweaks but overall impressed
- Monthly/bi-weekly strategic meetings (not weekly tactical)
    

### Next Steps
- Will to schedule regular demand gen meeting for later next week (include Nick)
- Make next meeting 1 hour duration
- Will to provide foundational context on current demand gen process and results
