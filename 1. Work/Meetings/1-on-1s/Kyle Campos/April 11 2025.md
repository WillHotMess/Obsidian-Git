## Meeting Details

- **Title**: Continuous Optimization Framework for FinOps Presentation Planning
- **Date & Time**: 2025-04-11 13:24
- **Location**: Virtual Meeting
- **Meeting Type**: Strategy Discussion

## Attendees
- William Norton
- Kyle Campos

## Summary
William and Kyle collaborated on developing a visual framework for a continuous optimization presentation, focusing on the "insight to action loop" concept. They created a circular loop model with various waypoints representing different stages of optimization. The discussion included how to integrate this model with different technology contexts (cloud services, Kubernetes, SaaS) and how AI/ML can accelerate each stage of the loop. They also discussed partnership arrangements with Cloud Eagle for an upcoming FinOpsX event.

## Agenda
- Create a framework for the continuous optimization presentation
- Develop visual representation of the insight-to-action loop
- Discuss DXC presentation needs and sustainability integration
- Review recent DXC call outcomes
- Discuss Cloud Eagle partnership for FinOpsX

## Discussion Notes
- **Continuous Optimization Loop Framework**:
    - Developed a visual circular model with waypoints representing the optimization process
    - Key waypoints identified: anomaly occurrence, insight, evaluation, prioritization, and action
    - Added a learning feedback loop to show continuous improvement
    - Discussed comparing "slow outer loop" (manual process) vs. "fast inner loop" (automated/AI-driven)
    - Proposed using the Interstellar time dilation concept as a metaphor for different optimization speeds
- **Technology Integration**:
    - Discussed how technology and AI can accelerate each stage of the loop
    - At the insight stage: Need for appropriate telemetry and anomaly definition
    - At the evaluation stage: Pattern recognition and policy automation
    - At the prioritization stage: Complexity scoring and implementation feasibility rating
    - Proposed an Eisenhower matrix approach for FinOps prioritization (cost impact vs. implementation difficulty)
- **DXC Presentation Planning**:
    - Discussed how to integrate sustainability aspects into the presentation
    - Noted challenges of presenting to a French audience and potential language accommodations
    - William suggested translator plugins for PowerPoint to help with international presentation
- **Recent DXC Call Update**:
    - Kyle reported positive engagement but noted Stefan seemed unfamiliar with optimization features
    - Cost reporting demo went well and was well received
    - StormForge trial progress moving slower than desired
- **Cloud Eagle Partnership**:
    - Discussed arrangements for FinOpsX event collaboration
    - William outlined partnership parameters: co-branded materials, shared booth presence, mention in presentations
    - Waiting on Cloud Eagle to confirm a raffle sponsorship

## Action Items
- [ ] William to create initial presentation deck structure before Monday
- [ ] Kyle to help fill in content spaces during the following week
- [ ] Schedule follow-up with Charles on Thursday
- [ ] William to forward Cloud Eagle partnership notes to Kyle
- [ ] William to contact Nidhi directly about FinOpsX sponsorship clarification
- [ ] Investigate PowerPoint translation plugin options for the DXC presentation in France

## Follow-up
- Next meeting date: Thursday (with Charles)
- Additional resources: Lucidchart shared for collaborative framework design
