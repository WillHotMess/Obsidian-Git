### Meeting Quality Issues

- Audio transcript severely corrupted/unclear
- Unable to extract meaningful content from garbled recording
- Most dialogue incomprehensible or fragmented

### Personal Plans Discussion

- Will’s upcoming travel
    - Going to Austin, Texas on Friday to visit friend
    - Birthday celebration - Will’s birthday July 5th, friend’s July 6th
    - Annual tradition of celebrating together
- Weather concerns
    - Current heat wave making activities difficult
    - Today’s high only 93°F (“basically jacket weather”)
    - Morning run was muggy and challenging

### Exercise Routine

- Will’s running schedule affected by heat
- Other participant mentioned riding Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday this week

### Note

- Raw notes indicated “No summary” - likely due to poor audio quality preventing effective note-taking during meeting
