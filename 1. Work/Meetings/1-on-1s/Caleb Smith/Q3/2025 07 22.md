### Top of mind

- MQL flow significantly decreased this quarter with only 13 MQLs compared to typical 5-10 per week
    
    - Most current MQLs are bots or automated demo requests rather than quality form fills
        
    - Need to address territory mapping logic that may be disadvantaging West Coast AEs Logan and Josh
        
- Compensation plan clarity urgently needed
    
    - Should be on 2024 plan structure with 20% bonus
        
    - Q1 and Q2 calculations require review and potential true-up
        
    - Mark escalating to executive team for resolution
        

### Updates and wins

- Pipeline activity remains strong despite lower MQL volume
    
    - Currently at 4 opportunities, increasing to 5 with Turnpoint Technology
        
    - FastWeb opportunity also pending creation
        
    - Quality remains high with large deal sizes, especially West Coast opportunities
        
- Territory performance insights
    
    - SoundCloud example: Champion in Denver/Colorado but company HQ in Germany
        
    - Samsung SDS: All contacts in San Diego/California but HQ mapped to New York
        
    - These HQ-based assignments may be misallocating quality opportunities
        

### Challenges and blockers

- Construction noise at apartment making work environment difficult
    
    - Consistent drilling into concrete floors
        
    - May need alternative workspace solution
        
- Steve’s departure creating process gaps
    
    - Discovery calls now running without AE support when scheduling conflicts arise
        
    - AEs reporting lack of support from Steve previously
        
- Outdated email sequences need refresh
    
    - FinOps and CMP sequences require updated website copy
        
    - HCM and “Augmented FinOps” terminology needs removal
        
    - No-show sequences need current content alignment
        

### Mutual feedback

- William provided guidance on discovery call process
    
    - Run calls with or without AE based on scheduling feasibility
        
    - Don’t delay for AE availability if client ready to proceed
        
    - Follow previous solo call process temporarily
        
- Territory mapping feedback requested
    
    - Analyze champion locations vs HQ locations for past quarter
        
    - Question current HQ-based assignment logic effectiveness
        
    - Consider champion-based mapping for better AE distribution
