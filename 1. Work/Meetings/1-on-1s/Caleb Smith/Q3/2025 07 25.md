### Workstreams

- **Logan Outreach**
    - Working through Greg/Jen handoff opportunities with clear process breakdowns
    - CC’ing Logan on all outreach for continuity
    - 6 different prospect paths identified, only 1 response so far (NTT - not looking at solutions currently)
    - Tailoring messages per prospect:
        - ST3Taylor (Brazil): Highlighting Ingram Micro partnership angle  
        - NTT: Focusing on centralized VM deployment/management needs 
        - University of Alabama: Personal touch with football reference, self-service VM requests focus
    - Will considers friendlier “what happened?” approach for warmer prospects vs product-focused rehook messaging
        
- **Post GenAI Event Outreach**
    - AWS EKS event follow-up sequence running in Salesforce
    - 55% unique open rate, 100% delivery
    - Only 1 response so far from unqualified lead
    - 70+ contacts from 13-14 event attendees (many Gmail addresses from lead capture.
    - Plan to have Josh reach out via LinkedIn InMail after email sequence completes
        - Caleb out of InMails until August 
        - Will provide LinkedIn profile URLs to Josh for outreach
            
- **Top Questions Analysis**
    - Current manual approach tracking common customer questions across Bill Ops, CMP, FinOps
    - Kubernetes optimization rarely comes up in conversations
    - Common themes: customer portal, identity/access management, integrations, licensing, scale, FedRAMP, automation, support/onboarding
    - New systematic approach proposed:
        - Pull 5 FinOps deals from last quarters via Gong
        - Extract questions + responses from discovery and demo calls
        - Use AI to build FAQ from transcript data
        - Repeat process for CMP vertical
            
- **Email Sequences Update**
    - Conversational email sequences still pending completion
    - New CMP sequence built but awaiting Josh review before Salesforce deployment
        
- **CloudEagle Webinar**
    - Will to handle setup today

### Compensation
- Q2 commission calculation shows $3,000 through payroll (Brendan’s analysis)
- Using marketing-sourced opportunities, new and upsell opportunities
- Missing outbound attribution data - Caleb needs to provide list
- Dispute over Callum’s pipeline qualification criteria:
    - Callum only pipes opportunities with “realistic chance of closing”
    - Requires multiple demos before pipeline movement
    - Caleb identifies inconsistency with other AEs’ practices
    - Example: IT&Sell opportunity ($100K ARR, Q3) not piped despite 4+ months, multiple calls
 
- 3 confirmed outbound opportunities identified:
    - Australian Department of Health (via Ross contact)
    - WorkJam (from FinOpsEC) 
    - One other chronic opportunity
- Strategy: Focus disputes on long-standing opportunities with multiple touchpoints, avoid recent/closed-lost deals
    

### Additional Items

- New CRO (Kino) starting Monday:
    - Strong track record, typically works with larger/mature companies
    - Emphasizes proof-of-concept excellence as critical success factor
