### Territory Management & Lead Distribution
- Focus on Josh and Logan territories for first round
    - Higher volume of leads compared to other reps
    - Samantha Gibbs backup if she provides leaked leads (unlikely)
- Excel spreadsheet shared covering current opportunities

### Closed Outbound Opportunities Review
- CH Robinson: Pure outbound from May, contact Jason Ward
    - LinkedIn outreach successful, Logan ran meeting
    - Current status unclear
- Australian Department of Health: Mark-requested outbound list
    - Ross targeted with AWS contacts and phone numbers
    - Catherine secured opportunity from initial outreach
- Work Channel: Strong performance noted

### Current Pipeline & Demo Schedule
- Tomorrow: AT prep call + demo (4-5:30 PM Eastern)
- Wednesday: Two demos scheduled
    - Turnpoint Technology

### Q2 Commission Calculator Issues
- Current Q2 showing lower than Q1 ($3,300)
    - Doesn’t account for outbound opportunities yet
- Q1 payout discrepancy identified
    - After-tax bonus significantly lower than expected
    - Need to review pre-tax vs post-tax calculations in pay stub
- Callum pipeline gaps identified
    - Several opportunities should have been piped but weren’t
    - Logan would have piped deals that showed product fit
    - Cloudflux example: $100K opportunity, 4 calls, multiple demos, active communication

### Next Steps
- Review Q1 payout calculation with Nick Mac and Brendan
- Monthly pipeline review calls with Nick to prevent future discrepancies
- Compile list of omitted opportunities that should be piped
    - Focus on open deals with multiple touchpoints
    - Provide specific context (call count, demos, pricing discussions)
- Submit opportunity list today for accurate Q2 payout
