# Mark & Will - 1:1

### Leadership Challenges

- Frustration with micromanagement style from Yasmin and Rod
    
    - Constant asks expanding scope without considering workload
        
    - Questioning of marketing priorities and work without visibility
        
    - “If Yasmin’s not across every detail of something she doesn’t believe it’s happening correctly”
        
- Need to create comprehensive marketing calendar
    
    - Will help provide visibility into all marketing activities
        
    - Mark will create calendar to address leadership’s concerns
        
- Challenging management relationship dynamics
    
    - Rod’s tendency to expand scope of requests continually
        
    - Yasmin acting as “henchman” for Rod’s management style
        
    - Need to reframe approach: leadership sees Will as highly valuable across areas
        

### Advertising Strategy & Budget

- StormForge PPC advertising issues
    
    - Google ads scaled down to near zero
        
    - Need to keep competitive keywords active (StormForge, KubeCost, Cast AI)
        
    - Reddit ads driving misleading metrics (28,000 clicks but only 17 trials)
        
    - Issue: Reddit ad looks like meme, causing accidental clicks (95% on mobile)
        
- Recommended ad strategy changes:
    
    - Move budget from Google to LinkedIn and Stack Overflow
        
    - Replace Reddit meme-style ads with more branded content
        
    - Target audience more precisely for StormForge
        
    - Build specific audiences for platform engineering at finance companies
        
- CMP advertising
    
    - Focus on Giga Ohm radar report and competitive positioning
        
    - Maintain minimal brand presence for FinOps
        
- Market demand observations
    
    - Limited demand for Kubernetes optimization keywords
        
    - Need to test targeting specific personas to confirm ROI
        

### StormForge Conversion Issues

- Free trial signups dropped after homepage change
    
    - Charles changed CTA from “Start Free Trial” to “Learn More”
        
    - Ads are sending traffic to solution page instead of optimized landing page
        
- Product homepage needs updating
    
    - Current header references cloud but needs updating to reflect StormForge focus
        
    - Will to follow up on homepage changes needed
        

### Sales Enablement & Reporting

- Morpheus takeout campaign needed
    
    - Need 5-step play for sales reps when they see Morpheus intent in Sixth Sense
        
    - Will include: Giga Ohm study findings, email templates, one-pager, CMP video
        
    - Mark will create skeleton framework for review
        
- Free trial conversion tracking
    
    - Recent signups visible in dashboard (12 leads in last 3 business days)
        
    - Josh working these leads but wants more
        
    - Yasmin arbitrarily set goal of 183 signups this quarter
        

### Converge Conference Planning

- Current registration status
    
    - 18 registrations currently (need 20 minimum)
        
    - 11 different companies represented, including 5 from Cigna
        
    - Mix of existing customers and partners (Beyond Trust, DXC, August Shell)
        
- ROI considerations
    
    - $50K out-of-pocket cost ($80K with AWS)
        
    - Usually expect 10x ROI on events
        
    - Need meeting Friday to discuss if event will move forward
        
    - Need to assess if this is the right approach vs. smaller targeted engagements
