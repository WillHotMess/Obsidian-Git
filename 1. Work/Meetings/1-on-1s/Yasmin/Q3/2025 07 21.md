### Marketing Ownership & Event Management

- Converge event lacking clear ownership/accountability
    
    - Felt like “hot potato” - multiple people involved, no single owner
        
    - Need one person to drive end-to-end vs distributing tasks
        
- William’s approach with speakers (especially Kyle)
    
    - Provides framework, gets approval, then drafts content
        
    - Limits Kyle’s time to ~90 minutes vs 10+ hours of work
        
    - Same model should apply to other speakers (Rick, Augie, Mike)
        
- Event logistics challenges
    
    - Hotel blocks, marketing outreach, speaker coordination all fall to one person
        
    - Need external help or dedicated operations support
        
    - Charles or former Stormforge HR person potential options
        

### Resource Constraints & Prioritization

- Too many marketing initiatives without adequate staffing
    
    - Forrester webinar next week - content not started
        
    - AWS re:Invent event - question whether to proceed given Erwin’s departure
        
- Need better “no” discipline across business
    
    - Pre-paid commitments (Forrester) creating pressure
        
    - Should evaluate ROI vs resource requirements before committing
        
- Kyle protection strategy
    
    - Avoiding over-delegation to engineering-focused CTO
        
    - Marketing should own content development with Kyle providing input only
        

### Lead Distribution & Territory Analysis

- Regional pipeline concerns
    
    - Josh (West): zero net new leads for Stormforge
        
    - Logan: light pipeline, worried about Q3/Q4
        
    - Traditional summer slowdown but deeper concerns exist
        
- Lead routing issues
    
    - Currently routes by company HQ vs champion location
        
    - West Coast champions going to East Coast reps
        
    - Need analysis of lead distribution by region
        
- Potential solutions
    
    - Redistribute leads from Sam (East) to Josh/Logan
        
    - Shift UK-based leads to Sam, move her overflow West
        
    - Route by champion location vs company headquarters
