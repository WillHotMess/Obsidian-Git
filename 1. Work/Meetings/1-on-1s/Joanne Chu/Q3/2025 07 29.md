### Content Strategy & Priorities

- Net new content recommendations per product (excluding FinOps)
    
    - CMP: Update 10 existing articles first before creating new content
        
        - Due date: August 30th
            
        - Priority ranking by total views or have Gleb choose most impactful pieces
            
        - Easy wins vs new content that takes 2-3 weeks
            
    - Infrastructure as code positioning: “microstrategy vs macro strategy” angle
        
    - Paved roads concept exploration
        
        - Fully autonomous deployments without approvals
            
        - “Are your paved roads really paved?” - FastPass lane analogy
            
        - Shadow IT prevention through proper automation
            
- Terraform content concerns
    
    - Attracts developers/coders, not decision-makers/buyers
        
    - Similar to writing about Python/JavaScript - wrong audience
        
    - Tread lightly on technical coding topics
        
- Feedback collection approach
    
    - Send curated lists to Rick for thought leadership picks
        
    - Consider Josh for customer-focused input vs Yasmin (avoid over-architecture)
        
    - Sales engineering slack survey option for top 3 picks
