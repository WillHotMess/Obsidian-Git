### Meeting Challenges & Content Strategy

- Yesterday’s call with Sam was frustrating
    - Disconnect in expectations and preparation
    - Communication issues between Rush and Sam’s team
- Content development challenges
    - Need to balance strategic frameworks with actionable recommendations
    - Joanne’s concern: Need concrete examples beyond “buy our product”
    - Will’s concern: Limited time to develop detailed content with only 4-5 days remaining
    - Challenge of creating recommendations without direct customer insights
- Strategic approach for content
    - Will create evaluation frameworks rather than specific technical recommendations
    - Will focus on questions to seed discussion between Tracy and Kyle
    - Will incorporate “Beyond Basic Metrics” strategic cloud KPIs from previous blog
    - Need to finalize deck by Monday and prepare questions for dry run

### Additional Projects

- Will mentioned Kubernetes airplane analogy he created
    - Extended analogy comparing Kubernetes components to airline operations
    - Will send to Joanne via Slack to review and potentially publish
    - Could be an “easy win” if technically accurate
