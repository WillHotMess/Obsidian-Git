[Hey, I've been researching relevant AI certifications for this year. There are a lot of highly technical options, but I'm not sure they strike the right balance of business imperatives. With Keno starting and his emphasis on POV/POC and value selling, it feels like a better understanding of organizational adoption AI is more important - considering it is at the center of most conversations. 

I found PMI's CPMAI certification that hits a sweet spot - covers AI technology selection, business value, implementation and rollout from the adoption perspective.](<**Subject:** Converge 2025 – Theme Recap & Presentation Framework

Hi Ludwig,

Thanks again for making time to connect. Really enjoyed the conversation—and I’m looking forward to having you at Converge. Your story is a strong fit for this year’s theme, and I think it’ll resonate across the room.

Let me give you a quick rundown of the key ideas, a suggested framework for your talk, and a lightweight template you can use to prep content. No pressure to make this overly polished—bullet points are great. I’ll help shape it into something presentable.

This year’s narrative centers on how cloud, finance, and operations teams are increasingly interdependent. The old silos are breaking down—either because orgs are maturing into more integrated models, or because modern companies (like yours) never had them to begin with.

We’re highlighting use cases where **Build**, **Manage**, and **Optimize** aren’t distinct phases, but part of a shared lifecycle. That’s where your story fits perfectly: you’re solving for deployment velocity, but doing it in a way that improves operational readiness and financial accountability downstream.

### 🧭 Suggested Presentation Structure (Target: 20 minutes)

Here’s a proposed flow that aligns with how the other sessions are being structured:

| Section                             | Focus                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Who is Lobster?**              | Quick intro to the business—your model, your role, and what makes you different                    |
| **2. What Was the Challenge?**      | Prior environment: manual provisioning, resource sprawl, reliance on a small team                  |
| **3. What Changed with CloudBolt?** | How you implemented it: blueprints, automation, provisioning time drop (6hrs → 25min)              |
| **4. Impact**                       | Key results: speed, consistency, security, cost controls (e.g. RDS automation, academy scheduling) |
| **5. What’s Next?**                 | Early thinking on platform engineering / IDP vision                                                |
| **6. Optional Visual**              | Quick demo or screenshot if you’re comfortable—just to ground the story                            |
| **7. Wrap & Q&A**                   | 2–3 minutes buffer for questions                                                                   |

### 📝 Prep Template (Fill This In When You Have Time)

This will help us shape the deck and align before the next working session. Feel free to edit this table and send it back, or just drop your notes in email/slack—whatever works best.

| Prompt                    | Your Input                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Company snapshot**      | [e.g. Who you serve, how you're structured]            |
| **Before CloudBolt**      | [e.g. Manual process, time required, operational pain] |
| **What you implemented**  | [e.g. Blueprints, lifecycle hooks, provisioning flow]  |
| **Key outcomes**          | [e.g. Time savings, consistency, operational impact]   |
| **Forward-looking ideas** | [e.g. Platform engineering, future use cases]          |

Let me know if this is missing anything. I’ll take whatever you send and start shaping it into slides. We can reconnect in mid-August to review and make adjustments together.

Also—per your ask—I’ll send a separate note with logistics and travel info for your team. Expect that shortly.

Appreciate you jumping in on this. I think your session’s going to stand out.

Best,

William
