    - Junior sales team requires significant guidance from Steve (CRO)
- **StormForge Product Integration**:

    - Concerns about market demand and go-to-market approach
    - Current StormForge approach focuses too much on engineers rather than economic buyers
    - William: "Their go-to-market is built for the end user, not for the buyer or the champion"

- **Free Trial and Lead Generation Issues**:
    - Discovered 68 people in the last two weeks didn't receive welcome emails due to Salesforce requiring last names
    - Discussion about requiring business email addresses for trials
    - Question whether the current trial approach generates quality leads
    - William: "If you're going to try to sell something and where you're like, we're competing against open source. So then it's a race to the bottom"
- **Messaging and Positioning Strategy**:
    
    - Need to define central pain point and solution across product lines
    - Challenge of positioning multiple products (CloudBolt, StormForge, HCM) under cohesive messaging
    - Discussion about market categories: Cloud Operational Management, Financial Management, Automation Orchestration
    - Potential focus on ROI messaging as a unifying theme
- **Sales Plays and Partner Materials**:
    - Mark noted that Rod (CEO) will likely focus on 3 key sales plays
    - Need for improved partner enablement materials similar to what Cloud Eagle presented

    - Discussion about creating simple, clear messaging kits for partners and internal use
