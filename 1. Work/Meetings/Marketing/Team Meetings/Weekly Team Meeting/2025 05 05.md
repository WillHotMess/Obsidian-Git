## Discussion Notes
- **Quarter Performance**: William reported quarter is tracking well toward budget. Pipeline is at 3.1M, over 100% of target with two months to spare. Strong performance of marketing-generated leads was acknowledged by Steve, particularly in EMEA.
- **SDR Report**: Caleb shared they've had 43 MQLs, 22 discovery calls booked with 19 held, 12 open opportunities, and $650K in open pipeline. Highlighted Mutual of Omaha as a significant returning opportunity ($200K deal) that had previously been a closed loss.
- **Geographic Lead Distribution**: The team discussed why EMEA is currently generating more opportunities, attributing it to regional adoption cycles and political/economic factors. William noted Europe tends to lag in tech trend adoption, with FinOps focus increasing there recently.
- **Gigaohm CMP Radar Submission**: William has largely completed the document with input from Kyle, Auggie, and Bombard. Needs to prepare for 30-minute meeting with analyst tomorrow, planning to structure around the Venn diagram shared by Gigaohm and introduce StormForge integration.
- **Gartner CFM MQ**: Submission is in progress. The team needs to increase Gartner Peer Insights reviews from the current single review to ideally 10-15. William and Mark are coordinating outreach through CSMs, support team, and SEs to generate more reviews.
- **StormForge Digital Spend**: Mark is evaluating the budget allocation between StormForge and Learn K8s, looking to optimize spend and potentially carve out funding for event management resources.
- **Messaging Exercise**: Working on formulaic approach to messaging that addresses pain points and demonstrates relief through pre-canned demos. Kubernetes messaging is furthest along as an exemplar.
- **Customer Insights Research**: Recently received research results that will provide sales with data points for challenger selling approach and demonstrate market empathy. Will serve as thought leadership content for FinOpsX.
- **Free Trial Email Nurture**: Joanne reported on the Kubernetes ready-to-run guide and Optimize Live free trial email nurture development. William emphasized the urgency of implementing the email nurture for trial signups, with HubSpot/Segment integration now technically possible.
- **PAYGO Strategy**: Discussion about when to introduce AWS Marketplace Pay-As-You-Go options in the nurture sequence. William's approach is to focus on product value early in the sequence and introduce purchasing options later when users have experienced value. Suggested adding PAYGO options directly in the product interface.
- **Website Updates**: Charles reported UberFlip is officially offline with minimal SEO impact so far. Working on domain-wide redirects for resources.cloudbolt.io to prevent broken backlinks.
- **UI/UX Developments**: Charles shared progress on product UI work including cost reporting features and integration of StormForge Kubernetes capabilities. Showed concept designs for TV dashboard view and honeycomb data visualization. Working on creating a proper design system based on material design.
- **FinOpsX Planning**: 30-day kickoff call scheduled for today at 3:30pm with key stakeholders including Cloud Eagle and Yasmin. Focus will be on booth design, graphics, solution briefs, and meeting scheduling with Chili Piper.
- **AWS Summit Participation**: Discussed potential submission of customer success story for the AWS Washington summit, with Erwin to manage the process.
