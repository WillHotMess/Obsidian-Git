## Discussion Notes
- **StormForge PPC Optimizations**:
    - Matthew implemented several changes to the StormForge campaigns, including switching to exact match keywords and limiting to Google search only (removing search partners)
    - Identified inflated conversion numbers (4,000+ reported conversions) due to tracking "free trial clicks" rather than actual form completions
    - Team determined this issue was not a priority to fix immediately but agreed to approach reporting with an understanding that numbers are directional rather than precise
    - Matthew also changed targeting to US-only, which should improve quality of traffic
- **Competitive Landing Pages**:
    - The Giga Report landing pages are being turned off, requiring redirects for competitive ads
    - Team decided to use Joanne's comprehensive tools guide blog post as a temporary solution
    - Charles to investigate updating CTAs on these pages from "Deserve better than Broadcom" to "Book a Demo"
- **AWS Marketing Spend**:
    - Team reviewed AWS-related spend totaling $16,000 in March
    - Discussion about reaching $20,000 in quarterly spend to qualify for AWS partner program benefits
    - Need to create documentation of AWS-specific spending for reporting purposes
- **LinkedIn Audience Analysis**:
    - Reviewed job titles and companies reached by recent boosted posts
    - Decision to exclude large consulting firms (EMY, Deloitte, Accenture, PWC) that consume budget without producing valuable leads
    - Discussion about targeting FinOps-focused LinkedIn member groups for upcoming boosted posts
- **Reddit Strategy**:
    - Identified subreddits for targeting including: Platform Engineering, Java, Kubernetes, Linux, DevOps, AWS, SRE
    - William shared insights about ads in forums being particularly valuable as AI increasingly cites sources from these platforms
- **Stack Overflow Opportunity**:
    - Nicole researched Stack Overflow as a potential advertising platform specifically for StormForge
    - Meeting scheduled with Stack Overflow on Tuesday to explore tag-based advertising options
    - William noted that Stack Overflow's value may increase as AI tools frequently cite it as a reference
