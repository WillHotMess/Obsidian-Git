### Newsletter Dashboard and Marketing Contacts Update

- Cass created newsletter dashboard for Joanne
    
    - Shows email engagement metrics: delivery rates, open rates, click rates, etc.
        
    - Includes conversion tracking (contacts who received email, engaged, created deal, closed deal)
        
    - Ludwig Mueller identified as current customer in renewal process (speaking at conference in a month)
        
    - Persona engagement insights:
        
        - Leon Finops Evangelist has highest engagement (based on job title)
            
        - Opportunities currently highest engaged (previously SQL - showing funnel movement)
            
        - Dashboard also shows engagement by contact creation year, country
            
        - Unknown country has many contacts - may need consolidation
            
- Marketing contacts updated to include “create date before 2020”
    
    - Brings total to 263,000 out of 300,000 limit (previously using only ~30% of available contacts)
        
    - Action item for Will: Review non-marketing contact list to ensure no customers who should be receiving information are excluded
        

### Website Refresh Project

- Redesigning website to shift from single FinOps product to portfolio company approach
    
- Project scope includes:
    
    - New home page built from ground up with more animations and engaging content
        
    - New secondary pages for personas, key features, and products
        
    - Updated navigation to highlight portfolio approach with use cases
        
- Proposed homepage feature:
    
    - Above-fold CTA allowing visitors to select products/solutions they want to learn about
        
    - Form will collect user selections and email address
        
    - Implementation options discussed:
        
        - Could route to landing page with links after selection
            
        - Could pre-populate checkboxes on standard form based on selections
            
        - Will use UTMs to track selections (similar to Cloud Zero implementation)
            
    - Form to be simplified - just name, company, email, and interests
        
- Charles will sign off on designs this week with building starting next week
    
- Consideration of “Proof” tool for showing social proof nudges on form pages
    

### Next Steps

- Charles to work with web team to determine most efficient HubSpot implementation
    
- Will to collaborate on UTM implementation for tracking user selections
    
- Reese continuing list audit to clean up HubSpot instance
    
    - Goal is to delete hundreds of unused or duplicate lists
        
    - Will make navigation and finding saved items easier
        
- Cass to look at adding demo CTA to newsletter for better attribution tracking
