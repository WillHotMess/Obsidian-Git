# CLOUDCHECKR COMPETITIVE BATTLECARD

## COMPANY OVERVIEW

CloudCheckr is a legacy Cloud Management Platform (CMP) with deep MSP/reseller market penetration but faces significant structural headwinds following multiple acquisitions. Originally independent, the platform has been through rapid ownership changes that cast uncertainty over its strategic direction and investment levels.

**Key Facts:** • Company: CloudCheckr → NetApp (2021) → Flexera (2025) • Founded: 2011 • HQ: Rochester, NY (original) • Funding: $67.4M raised pre-acquisition ($50M Series A in 2017, $15M in 2019) • Acquisition History:

- Oct 2021: Acquired by NetApp for $347M
- Jan 2025: Sold to Flexera for ~$100M (87% value loss) • Market Focus: MSPs, CSPs, Cloud Resellers • Customer Base: 40% of top 50 global MSPs (2019 claim)

## PRODUCT OVERVIEW

CloudCheckr positions itself as a "single pane of glass" for hybrid cloud management with specialized MSP billing capabilities. Post-Flexera acquisition, it's positioned to fill gaps in Flexera One's FinOps portfolio.

**Core Capabilities:** • Multi-cloud cost management (AWS-centric, limited Azure, minimal GCP) • MSP-specific billing and margin management tools • Reserved Instance & Savings Plan arbitrage • Multi-tenant account management (Multi-Account Views) • Security and compliance monitoring (35+ frameworks) • Cost visibility, analytics, and reporting • White-labeling capabilities • Role-based access control (RBAC)

**Limitations:** • No Kubernetes cost management support • 30-day maximum cost forecasting horizon • Separate logins required for AWS/Azure (no unified dashboard) • No certified PSA integrations (ConnectWise, Autotask) • Limited GCP support (not substantiated in documentation) • Poor reporting flexibility and historical trend analysis

**Architecture Notes:** • Multi-tenant platform with "Multi-Account View" (MAV) construct • REST API available but limited integration ecosystem • Requires manual processes for PSA integration • Performance issues reported ("slow to load and generate reports")

## PRICING

**Licensing Model:** [Specific pricing model not detailed in source document]

**Pricing Challenges:** • No transparent public pricing - requires quotes • Complex "Workload Element" (WE) counting methodology • Even discovered/unmanaged resources count toward licensing • High potential TCO when including implementation, training, and support

## LANDMINES

|LANDMINE|REASON|
|---|---|
|CORPORATE INSTABILITY|87% value loss in <5 years, 3 owners in 4 years, uncertain product roadmap|
|NO KUBERNETES SUPPORT|Zero capabilities for container cost management - critical gap for modern workloads|
|NO PSA INTEGRATIONS|Missing certified integrations with ConnectWise/Autotask - creates operational bottleneck|
|POOR USER EXPERIENCE|"Clunky," "non-intuitive" UI, slow performance causing operational delays|
|SUPERFICIAL MULTI-CLOUD|Requires separate logins for AWS/Azure, no true unified view|
|30-DAY FORECAST LIMIT|Cannot support strategic planning or long-term commitment decisions|
|INCONSISTENT SUPPORT|Polarizing reviews, inability to solve complex problems|
|"BLACK BOX" PERCEPTION|Community perception of tool used to hide value, not create it|

## WHY WE WIN

**Key Advantages Over CloudCheckr:** ✓ Kubernetes Cost Management - Full container cost allocation vs. zero support ✓ True Multi-Cloud Dashboard - Single pane of glass vs. separate logins ✓ Native PSA Integrations - Certified ConnectWise/Autotask vs. manual processes ✓ Extended Forecasting - 12+ months vs. 30-day limit ✓ Modern UI/UX - Intuitive interface vs. "clunky" experience ✓ Stable Ownership - Vendor independence vs. acquisition uncertainty ✓ Automated Remediation - Policy-based automation vs. limited capabilities ✓ Transparent Value Creation - Partner enablement vs. "black box" arbitrage ✓ Consistent Support Quality - Enterprise-grade support vs. inconsistent service

## WHY WE LOSE

**Scenarios Where CloudCheckr May Win:** • Deep MSP Billing Requirements - Organizations needing complex RI arbitrage and price books • Legacy AWS-Only Environments - Pure AWS shops not needing multi-cloud • Existing CloudCheckr Investment - High switching costs and operational disruption • Flexera Bundle Deals - When bundled with broader Flexera One suite • Compliance-Heavy Requirements - Organizations prioritizing 35+ framework coverage • Basic Requirements Only - MSPs focused solely on billing without modern workload management

## WEAKNESSES

**Critical CloudCheckr Vulnerabilities:**

**Technical Weaknesses** • No Kubernetes Support - Cannot manage primary modern cost drivers • Superficial Multi-Cloud - AWS-biased, separate dashboards, limited GCP • 30-Day Forecast Limitation - Insufficient for strategic planning • Poor UI/UX - "Extremely non-intuitive," slow performance • Missing PSA Integrations - Creates manual operational overhead • Limited Reporting - Inflexible, poor historical analysis

**Strategic Weaknesses** • Post-Acquisition Uncertainty - Unclear roadmap under Flexera • Value Destruction - 87% loss under NetApp ownership • Loss of Independence - No longer vendor-agnostic • Stagnant Innovation - Failed strategic integration at NetApp • Talent Risk - Potential exodus post-acquisition

**Commercial Weaknesses** • Opaque Pricing - Complex WE model, hidden costs • High TCO - Implementation, training, maintenance costs • Integration Tax - Manual PSA reconciliation costs • Competitive Disadvantage - Even HPE chose CloudBolt over Morpheus

## PROOF POINTS

**User Feedback:** • "90% or 95% of our billing issues started going away" - Cloud Comrade MSP • "extremely non intuitive" - Gartner Reviewer • "poor UX & UI experience...slow to load" - Gartner Reviewer  
• "reporting and analytic capabilities are very limited" - AWS Marketplace • "couldn't provide" in-depth technical assistance - Service Provider

**Market Perception:** • Reddit: "lock you out of Billing services to hide their discount" • Processing time: Reduced from 6.5 days to 12 hours (PTP MSP) • G2 Ratings: Ease of Use 7.7/10, Support 7.8/10 • Gartner: 3.8/5.0 overall (24 ratings)

**Discovery Questions:** • "How do you provide Kubernetes cost allocation for containerized workloads?" • "Can you show AWS and Azure costs in a single dashboard today?" • "What's your monthly effort to reconcile CloudCheckr with your PSA?" • "How do you forecast beyond 30 days for annual budgets?" • "What has Flexera communicated about CloudCheckr's roadmap?"

## CONCLUSION

CloudCheckr represents a legacy MSP billing tool struggling to remain relevant in the modern cloud era. While its deep billing and margin management capabilities serve a specific niche, the platform suffers from fundamental technology gaps (no Kubernetes support, weak multi-cloud), operational inefficiencies (no PSA integrations, poor UI), and strategic uncertainty (87% value destruction, unclear Flexera roadmap).

The platform wins in pure MSP billing arbitrage scenarios but fails to address the evolution toward value-based managed services. Modern MSPs need comprehensive workload management, seamless operational integration, and forward-looking capabilities - all areas where CloudCheckr demonstrably falls short. The constant ownership changes and rebrandings signal a product searching for strategic fit rather than confidently executing a vision.
