# CloudBolt Expands Multi-Cloud Support with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Integration

**CloudBolt is proud to announce the addition of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to our growing list of supported cloud platforms, expanding our multi-cloud reporting and dashboard capabilities to give you complete visibility across your entire cloud fabric.**

## Unifying Your Oracle Cloud Data with Your Multi-Cloud Strategy

As organizations increasingly embrace multi-cloud strategies that include OCI alongside AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, the need for unified financial visibility has become critical. With enterprises reporting that they use an average of 4+ FinOps tools, the complexity of managing cloud costs across disparate platforms continues to grow.

Our customers have spoken, and we've listened. By extending CloudBolt's reporting and dashboarding capabilities to include OCI, we're tackling one of the most pressing challenges in cloud financial management today: fragmented visibility across cloud environments.

## Close the "Insight-to-Action" Gap with Comprehensive OCI Reporting

CloudBolt's OCI integration delivers the reporting capabilities you need to make confident, data-driven decisions:

- **Unified Multi-Cloud Visibility**: View OCI costs alongside your AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud spending in a single, centralized dashboard
- **Comprehensive Cost Reporting**: Track and analyze OCI spending patterns with detailed breakdowns by compartment, service, and resource type
- **Business-Aligned Reporting**: Map OCI costs to your organization's unique business structure through our flexible grouping and tagging capabilities
- **FOCUS-Ready Data Platform**: Leverage the FinOps Foundation's Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS) for standardized data across all supported clouds

## Built on Our Reimagined FinOps Data Platform

This integration leverages CloudBolt's recently announced FOCUS-ready data platform, designed from the ground up to address the fundamental big data challenges faced by FinOps teams. By normalizing cloud cost data across providers, including Oracle Cloud, we enable you to make true apples-to-apples comparisons and optimize your multi-cloud investment strategy.

## What's Next
While this initial release focuses on reporting and dashboarding capabilities for OCI, we're actively developing optimization features that will be available in future updates. Our roadmap includes bringing the full power of CloudBolt's Augmented FinOps capabilities to OCI customers, including AI/ML-informed cost insights and automated optimization actions.
