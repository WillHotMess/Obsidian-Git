Next week, Nick (VP of Sales Operations) and I are presenting a StormForge GTM report for our executive leadership team. This is a political conversation, that we will need to approach pragmatically, using a data driven approach. Our concerns are largely that our new CEO (Rod) and CSO (Yasmin) are extremely protective of the StormForge world, and have a track record of sensitivity to any flashlights on perforrmance. To date efforts have fallen on deaf ears. 
Our new CRO, Keno, is looking to reignite the conversation. Here is his email: 
```
Nick, 
Please pull together a call with this distribution sometime after Brendan gets back from PTO (week after next) to discuss Paygo and our Storm Forge trial/sandbox/sign up process. Please also pull the metrics around pipeline, paygo revenue, and conversion rate in advance of the discussion.
```

The task at hand is to pull together a few slides that share the to-date spending across product (hosting costs), marketing efforts (ads, events, etc), against results - free trial sign-ups, installs, pipeline, marketplace revenue,  net-new direct business, and overall ARR.  I Need your help shaping this to be most effective. 

For additional context, review the following: 
```
# Ad Approach: 
Marketing has made the following changes In the past few months to optimize ad spending: 
<
**StormForge**

**Current Status:**

- **Reddit:** Moving away from meme-style ads (causing inflated clicks, low intent). Focus on brand-first content and thought leadership posts
- **Google PPC:** Should be paused except for competitive keywords (StormForge, Kubecost, Cast AI, Scale Ops searches) – this is due to poor performance and low demand overall. 
- - PPC StormForge Keep money in for SF Competitive and refocus on: [Cast.AI](http://cast.ai/), PerfectScale, KubeCost (move KubeCost over from other campaign)
- **LinkedIn:** NEW - Build targeted audiences around platform engineering personas and finance companies (shared the doc last week, let me know if that is directionally helpful). 
- **Stack Overflow:** NEW - Target engineering personas with very specific keywords - pilot starting in September for 30 days focused on SME identified tags. 
- LinkedIn NEW - In September, Pilot a FinTech focused LinkedIn advertising campaign that is geared toward Director+ Platform Engineering / DevOps / Cloud Leaders in US and EMEA. 
**Goal:** Final test to determine if targeted advertising works for StormForge at all. If these targeted approaches fail, we may need to have a larger strategy conversation around SF.
* Reminder that these are all pointing directly to the SF free trial sign-up (and have been to date)*

# Free Trial Nurture: 
<
Recap
Going live with a nurture campaign for free trial users ASAPTwo distinct nurture paths have been created:Path A: For users who sign up but don't install Path B: For users who complete installation (guidance through the trial process)CTAs in emails will prompt users to schedule calls with (product, sales, solution teams) at various stages:Early-stage emails focus on product guidance & consultingLater-stage emails focus on sales opportunitiesWhen users click CTAs, they'll be directed to a form requiring business email (no Gmail), creating qualified leadsAfter completing the lead form, users will be immediately exposed to Josh's calendar to book a 30-minute call directlyThe system will associate "ghost contacts" (Gmail signups) with their business information through tenant IDAll relevant free trial data (tenant ID, signup date, user ID, etc.) will be accessible in Salesforce
/>

# Prior PLG Call Outs: 
I personally have shared concerns about our free trial approach compared to market-researched approaches - mainly, how our competitors run this motion.  
<
**Leadership Team,**

I spent some time navigating CAST.ai's free trial process last week and discovered several qualification methods they're using to balance free trial access with quality lead capture.  As our top direct competitor, their approach would be a good one to consider.

**Findings:** (Screenshots attached)

**Email Validation**: 

·        CAST.ai blocks personal email addresses (Gmail, etc.), requiring organization-affiliated addresses.  While not foolproof (an .edu email worked), this simple gate may significantly reduce "ghost" leads.  

·        They also require email confirmation for non-connected options (GitHub + Gmail Business Account) before proceeding, adding a verification step.

**Required Registration Data**: At the first sign-in, Cast requires:

·        Business email

·        Full name

·        Phone number

·        Company name

·        Job title (from predetermined options, not free text)

**Guided User Experience**:

·        Upon first login, Cast has an unprompted in-product guided tour

·        Timed questionnaires that appear during product exploration (using TypeForm)

**In-Product Resources & Conversion Points**:

·        Educational videos, demos, and tutorials are placed throughout the console

·        Help guides are accessible at particular points in the user journey

·        Conversion opportunities, such as, "Talk to Product Team" and "Book a Demo" prompts show up multiple times

We should explore these options to see if we can maintain our PLG motion while improving lead quality and conversion rates.   

**What We're Doing to Increase Conversion Now:**

Starting this week, we're implementing a free trial nurture program that builds on the current approach (which only includes "welcome" and "trial expiration" emails).

The new nurture strategy includes:

·        **Bifurcated User Journey**: We've designed separate email paths for users who install vs. those who don't, with each path addressing specific conversion barriers.

·        **Strategic Touchpoints**: Increased from just 2 to 8+ strategic touchpoints throughout the trial journey, including installation guidance, recommendation reviews, and technical integration support.

·        **Conversion Approach**: Clear pathways to both self-service AWS Marketplace purchases and sales-assisted conversations.

Let me know if you have any questions.

# Transcripts: 
I have attached a couple of transcripts from our call with Keno and my 1:1 with Nick. 
<
Me: We'll have a bunch of synapse.
Me: And very little installs.
Them: Yeah.
Me: So here is.
Me: The installs.
Me: Here is the sign ups. Okay, so here's signups.
Me: This is just the last 180 days.
Me: This is.
Me: Actually has both.
Me: Okay?
Me: Cool.
Me: I'm going to make sure. We need to check on how many of these are pick pay, though.
Me: So we only have 45 installs.
Me: Out of however many records this is. Let's look.
Them: What is that?
Them: Sigmund.
Me: 504.
Them: Less than 10%.
Me: And I mean, that's, that's not even including if their kick pay, which I need to look at, but because a lot of them probably will be.
Me: I had a report that I was looking at and see.
Them: We don't have them filtered out of these reports.
Them: I thought we did.
Me: She was gonna do that.
Me: And then. I don't know.
Me: What? Because, like, would it be current?
Me: Customer.
Them: I remember what she was. I think she was making a known checkbox.
Them: But like a known function.
Them: Where no one was true.
Them: If current customer.
Them: And then that allowed the opportunity for other things.
Them: I don't remember specifically. This was right before I went on.
Me: I know.
Me: I just dropped so I can. Let's just create a report real quick.
Them: I thought she had a report already built with those filters on it.
Me: Maybe.
Them: Anything we need to accomplish before partway is here.
Them: I just want your thumbs up on that instructions.
Them: Thing for email follow up so I can send that shit out.
Me: Yeah.
Me: You updated with the newer stuff, right?
Them: Yeah.
Me: I think I looked through it last week.
Them: I can't put the examples.
Them: I copy pasted.
Them: Like your bill ops shit.
Me: Yeah.
Me: I think that was the only change I recognized. That was it, right?
Them: There were some other simple ones.
Me: Yeah.
Me: You're good.
Me: Thanks.
Me: For.
Them: Remember?
Me: Thanks for waiting on me, but I have no issues with it.
Me: I think it's good.
Me: I, like, breeze through it. When you send to me last week for like 12 seconds.
Me: And nothing stuck out of me.
Me: All right.
Me: So for next week.
Me: How do you want to.
Them: I want to do. I'm going to schedule for, like, late in the week.
Them: Because I'm not confident. My meeting was sanity will result in all the data I need.
Them: So I'm assuming that it'll take me, like, all week to get the access and the data that I need.
Them: The other reason is we have another one of our calls.
Them: Next Monday.
Them: So we can use that to sort of tidy up our message.
Them: The other reason is I want to give Brendan a few days back so that.
Them: Shouldn't even be talking about him.
Them: Because he's not my boss.
Them: But I want to give him and Kino enough time with the data.
Them: Massage or prepare for the meeting.
Them: That way, they're not just seeing it for the first time.
Them: When we present it to the whole group.
Them: I know that's kind of cheating.
Them: Because we're not also sending it to Yasmin and Rod, but I don't really care.
Them: We know we're fighting an uphill battle here.
Me: I think that's absolutely right.
Me: It's not to help Brendan.
Me: It's to help us because.
Them: Trying to make this company better.
Them: And I'm afraid if we don't have the right arrows in our quiver,
Them: It's going to be the same solium dance from fucking Rodney Asman.
Them: But that's my plan.
Them: I have not scheduled it yet.
Them: I was aiming for, like, Thursday afternoon.
Them: But my Thursdays are dollar shit.
Them: So maybe Wednesday afternoon.
Them: We're all completely packed next weekend.
Them: Because of all this training going on.
Me: What?
Me: Hold on.
Them: What are you working on here?
Them: View on our pork, I thought for sure.
Them: Her reports were already filtered on that dashboard.
Me: He has one, but it doesn't look like it's right.
Me: Hold on.
Me: I'll show you what I'm talking about.
Me: Let's say yes.
Me: How about such a piece of shit?
Me: On this browser.
Them: Now see how that's already got pick pain.
Me: Well, yes.
Me: It does. But look, there's more people signing up from pickpay. There's pp, IO.
Me: Remember? There's all these different domains. I was trying to walk her through. It doesn't look like she upped that filter.
Me: Because if you just look at the Slack user channel,
Me: There's other ones that are new that would fall into this report, so clearly that is not working.
Me: Create a date is year to date.
Me: Let's just do this.
Me: Year.
Me: Okay?
Me: So trial.
Me: Date.
Me: Sorry. I'll sign update.
Me: Trial sign update.
Me: Is.
Me: Here.
Them: Izzy, can you get out, please?
Me: Because, like, look, there's hsbc.
Me: I think we're going to do the salesforce.
Me: Some sort of Salesforce flag. I don't think we should leave it to her. I think we should use, like, a customer. Current customer equals yes or something.
Me: Which we could bring in.
Them: But we're going to have to figure it out.
Them: If her way right now is close, but there's a few stragglers.
Them: It's still going to be directionally accurate.
Them: And based on the data we just saw, it's still dog shit, even with a little bit of that fluff in there.
Them: The reason I'm hesitant is any sort of Salesforce flag would then require that person to exist in Salesforce.
Them: With that email associated to them.
Them: And associated to the customer account and.
Me: What, do you need that company name to exist?
Me: Oh, right.
Them: See what I mean?
Them: If the human doesn't associate to the company.
Them: Salesforce isn't going to do any better than this.
Me: I also can just do a one time report right now.
Me: We do need to get her a list of.
Me: The other thing is, we don't even know if some of these Gmails that were like, oh, maybe that's not pick pay, like that could be.
Me: Right.
Me: We have no idea.
Them: Absolutely.
Me: So I don't really know.
Them: Message.
Them: We could. Yeah.
Them: I guess it's not perfect.
Them: But I think for the message.
Them: That's part of our point.
Them: Is. Who the fuck are these Gmail people?
Them: So we don't know if those are even opportunities.
Them: To sell software.
Them: To somebody.
Them: Or if their actual opportunities to do business with a customer.
Them: My problem with the whole thing is, like, oh, well, DevOps engineers want to be anonymous.
Them: And they only have discretionary budgets and blah, blah, blah.
Them: Their discretionary budget is given to them by a company.
Them: It's not their personal wallet, first and foremost.
Them: So regardless, they should be able to tell me which company gave them the discretion discretionary budget.
Them: But two, if this is a real opportunity.
Them: That we're going to spend sales resources on.
Them: We shouldn't just be targeting discretionary budgets.
Me: That's been my thing ever since the dawn of Donovalis. Both of us.
Me: Have said that.
Me: Like, okay.
Me: So what?
Me: Then why are we even spending money?
Them: Profound. My point is just like as you're looking at the data and perspective, like, the data may not be perfect.
Them: But if we can sort of align it in that messaging of.
Them: Here are a bunch of trials that signed up. They're all fucking Gmails.
Them: And none of them have resulted in revenue.
Them: Meanwhile, we spent thousands of dollars supporting the free trial instance doing ads.
Them: All of this other shit.
Them: That right there proves the point that Kino needs to see is say we're done doing it this way.
Them: So I think as we can get closer to that.
Them: Answer.
Them: We'll be able to tidy it up a little bit.
Them: One of the reasons I'm not confident Sandy's going to have the right answers tomorrow.
Them: Is because Sandy having the right answer requires stormforge engineers to have tagged all of our workloads correctly.
Them: Which ones are production?
Them: Which ones are supporting the free trial.
Them: Are all the ones supporting the free trial marked correctly.
Them: Are there a bunch of different categories that are considered the free trial? I doubt Sandy's going to know all those answers.
Them: Unless they're all perfectly labeled. Stormforge Free trial.
Me: DirecTV is another one, right?
Them: Yeah.
Me: Look at this really quick.
Me: Custom Inc. Is that another one?
Them: Let's customer.
Them: I don't know when they started their free trial, though. Like you're looking at six months.
Them: Of data.
Them: Right.
Me: Here today.
Me: I changed it.
Me: Oh, yeah. Cloud bolt.
Me: What about cognizant? I see a lot of cognizant too.
Me: Like carfax.
Them: Not a customer.
Me: Us bank.
Me: Try to get rid of that.
Me: Experian. That's another one we're talking to, right?
Them: We might be talking to them. I don't think they're a customer.
Them: Though.
Me: I mean, if it's an active opportunity.
Me: Then it doesn't count as a free trial. Sign up.
Them: What can you prove from there? That it's active?
Them: Because they sign up for a trial.
Them: Or you're saying.
Me: Oh. I mean, it would have been before us. Yeah.
Me: Right.
Me: Like all these companies.
Me: All right, so roughly, like this is probably pretty good.
Me: We have 763this year.
Me: That have signed up.
Me: Two that have installed.
Me: That doesn't make any sense.
Me: Is that right?
Me: No.
Me: Okay?
Me: That was not right.
Them: Have to check the date on my end, but if I'm right, there are two customers.
Me: 54.
Them: That have generated committed revenue through the free product sign up for a grand total of $5,400.
Me: This divided by this.
Me: No.
Me: Equals this.
Me: Divided by this.
Me: 7% actually sign up.
Me: So just putting that perspective, we have paid for 763.
Me: Instance.
Me: Of stormforge.
Me: And only 54 have used it.
Me: Now.
Them: This fiscal year.
Them: You say?
Me: This is weird, but the question then would be do we have counting the free trial install post acquisition or did we already have that?
Me: We already have that, right?
Them: Where do we have that data?
Me: Would it be in HubSpot?
Them: Should be.
Them: I'm pulling up.
Me: Because.
Them: Their old salesforce too.
Them: Just to validates in this.
Me: I'm only seeing. Well, I guess three, four would have been before the acquisition, right?
Me: So yeah.
Me: We have it.
Me: Because this is. This goes back way for the acquisition.
Me: So now. I mean, now, let's just filter to this.
Me: Get rid of the blanks. Let's look at these.
Me: Are any of these current customers?
Me: Cortex swish analytics iterable. Go pebble persistent densify. That's a competitor.
Me: Isn't that a competitor?
Me: Pretty sure.
Me: Okay?
Me: Go soft. Coralogics, Hyperhaven.
Me: Okay?
Me: So then the other thing would be, how many of these do we actually have their business email?
Me: Let's see.
Me: One, two.
Me: I'm just going to assume edus are actually es03.
Me: Four.
Me: Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Me: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
Me: 2023.
Me: 24, 25, 25, 25. It's only half of the signups we have, really emails for. And that's assuming these are real emails.
Me: I actually don't know.
Me: Some of these might not be.
Me: It's gonna be interesting.
Me: When standing to get you the number, because even if it's a swag,
Me: Even if it's a range.
Me: Of what we think it cost to host Stormforge for a month.
Me: And by the way, this actually shouldn't be that difficult because if it's all AWS hosted cost, they should be able to look at one app instance.
Me: And that you'll just have to trust the expert.
Me: On this.
Me: It's a very easy thing to go, okay?
Me: This is one instance. Here it is.
Me: I don't know why that would be difficult.
Them: Should. Are you confident that one app is very clearly the free trial?
Them: Because I'm not.
Me: Oh, no, I mean, like, they. They should have separation of the tenants because of. Yeah, yeah.
Them: Sure.
Them: But then we just did that event.
Them: Are we confident the same instance was used?
Them: For all Things Considered, free trials.
Them: Again. Should they should use that one.
Me: Don't they have sock compliance, though?
Me: They have soc 2 compliance.
Me: Are they?
Me: Yeah, sure. Okay.
Me: You're right.
Them: Who?
Me: Maybe not.
Me: I mean, but like the way that kubernetes, I imagine they're labeling using kubernetes.
Me: They should be able to go.
Me: This is one instance.
Them: I 100% agree.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I've always Stormforged has done shit, and it's not the way that.
Me: That's fair.
Me: Totally fair.
Me: It's totally fair.
Me: I mean, here's what we're looking at.
Me: We're looking at eight months into the year.
Me: 54 people have actually installed this.
Me: Right.
Me: So we've spent a ton of dollars to get 764 free trials.
Me: And only 54 have done anything with it.
Me: And that's. By the way, that's not even we know who they are.
Me: And we've got no.54 have even decided to install this on their cluster.
Me: What we know is 764 instances of Stormforge were created on very fast technology for 30 days, probably longer. Probably 30 to 45 days, maybe even 60. Like, I don't know when they spend this stuff down, but I assume they're probably doing 45 to 60 days.
Me: All of that's money we're spending. 54 have actually installed. I'll bet if you were to take this one step down the funnel further and go, how many of them logged on more than once?
Me: You're 54 becomes 30.
Them: Sorry.
Them: Apple update. Dog on drugs.
Them: Is like pacing around my office.
Them: And ripping up computer paper, and it's, like, so distracting.
Me: Three.
Them: Get out.
Me: Maybe to roll this all up.
Me: Total signups.
Me: With the filter criteria we used, and I can pull some of this together.
Me: With the filter criteria we use total installs.
Me: Against a swag assumed hosting cost. If you cool to see hosting cost, how long we host it.
Me: And then things like, hey, we don't even know if they signed in more than once.
Me: But when you start to filter this down,
Me: Every single person who's signed up since I we kicked off the email campaign.
Me: Has received multiple emails.
Me: To do something with this.
Me: And we've had zero conversions from that.
Them: Yeah, I'm just trying to. Zero conversion since the start of the year.
Them: It seems at least.
Them: And then there's like, I'm trying to take the other route, right?
Them: Like, what revenue do we have?
Them: That's existing from that source.
Them: Whether it's this fiscal year or not. And then is there actually open pipeline?
Them: For the same.
Me: 709 people have installed this.
Me: That were paying for.
Them: So there's 200k of open pipeline.
Them: With this source.
Them: 70k of that.
Them: Is with iris.
Them: Who we know decided not to do a committed deal and wanted to just go to Paygo.
Them: Another majority of that is Wabtech and Novo Nordisk.
Them: Novo just gave another shit outlook.
Them: On their revenue for the rest of the year.
Them: So I don't know if they're buying anything.
Them: Soon.
Them: Novo is forecasted for this year.
Them: But hard to say whether that's actually real.
Them: Oh, it said poc in march. All right, so it's now august.
Them: And. And you still haven't closed that deal.
Them: He hasn't reached out since June.
Them: So there is a real pipeline open here either.
Me: Meanwhile, we are spending.
Me: $3,500 a month just on Reddit.
Them: Just on Reddit.
Them: Jesus christ.
Me: I have told them to pull back on a ton of this stuff.
Them: So in two months we spend more on one.
Me: Channel.
Them: Channel.
Them: Then we've gained revenue from this lead source.
Me: Oh, yeah.
Me: Buy it.
Me: Buy them. Buy a bet.
Me: And this is the thing.
Me: Man.
Me: I've got our agency going every week. They're like, you realize this is. We should be doing this.
Me: I finally was like, pull back.
Me: Absolutely. Pull back.
Me: On.
Me: Pppc for sure.
Me: Like google.
Me: There's no intent. Nobody is interested in this stuff.
Me: At all.
Me: Here, you look at this.
Me: And this one was this.
Me: This is the QBR reports the last quarter, so we spent.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Seven grand right there.
Me: Seven grand right there.
Me: So $14,000.
Them: This is a quarter. Yeah.
Them: This is a quarter.
Me: So you say. $14,000 on one channel, by the way.
Me: Doesn't include ppc.
Me: There's another.
Me: Brand.
Me: So there was Stormforge, okay?
Me: 14,000 clicks.
Me: Right here. Look at these clicks.
Me: This is what baffles me.
Me: Right.
Me: So you put that together at 61? What?
Me: Six thousand people clicked on these ads and went to the stormforge page.
Me: And of that.
Me: I don't even know what the. I haven't matched this against series. I just showed. But even if you were to take all of this year and put it against that dollar amount,
Me: Seven hundred people did something.
Me: Realistically, this is last quarter. It's probably like 300.
Me: And how many people actually installed the damn thing.
Me: So spend $14,000.
Me: And again, it's a black funnel.
Me: Like, I think we also need to show the funnel and be like, here's the dollar going in.
Me: Here's the amount of volume.
Me: Here's what people are actually converting.
Me: Then we know that windows down to 54 people that actually installed it.
Me: There's two more clicks of this. Of, like, how many people actually logged in? We don't know.
Me: That's only product analytics.
Me: They could tell us that, but I'll bet of that 54.
Me: It's 15.
Them: I could probably get that through segment.
Them: It's not like a button, but the way you were just describing it is exactly how I picture it. We could effectively probably tell this message.
Them: On one or two slides.
Me: Y.
Them: Where you're showing the spend per channel.
Them: In red up at the top. The free trials and the installs are in the middle.
Them: And the revenues at the bottom.
Them: Revenue can be in green.
Them: But it'll be so fucking little that we'll have a big red negative number at the bottom.
Them: But we can clearly point to, even just for this year to date,
Them: At this point.
Me: Eah.
Me: And these ads are hitting benchmarks.
Me: Like they're not that far off from industry benchmarks.
Me: So I don't want to hear it from anybody.
Me: That's like.
Me: Are they working or not?
Me: 23,000.
Me: I mean, just compare this.
Me: Just in your mind, right?
Me: We spend.
Me: Let's just see.
Them: Like this. This will be so obvious.
Them: To Keno because it'll fit his plan.
Them: So well.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Because of how he's communicated. Like, I want less pipeline and higher conversion.
Them: He wants less install and sign up noise.
Them: And higher rates of them converting to revenue.
Them: What we're going to show is like, oh, everyone's patting each other on the back for spending a shitload of money to get a bunch of signups that go absolutely.
Them: Nowhere.
Them: And just costing us money.
Me: Well.
Them: Yeah.
Them: That's frustrating.
Them: On the revenue side.
Them: I'm obviously going to include pay go. And depending on what the numbers look like, once I get them, I'm even going to extrapolate for them and make them feel good.
Them: This person signed up for one month.
Them: And terminated already.
Them: Let's say they didn't. Here's the annualized amount they would have paid us.
Them: We are still spending way fucking too much.
Them: To capture that sort of revenue.
Me: This is where it's like,
Me: What are we asking to do? What we're asking to do is at least make the dollars.
Me: I'm optimizing ads.
Me: We're definitely not going to be spending $14,000.
Me: This quarter. It's just asinine.
Me: But we will be spending a lot. But at minimum, we need to kind of adopt that keynote mindset of.
Me: We're not going to give you a free trial.
Me: If you're not willing to give us a business email.
Me: Especially when only 7% of people actually install. So we're going to go host, and I'm just going to throw at a hypothetical number here.
Me: But.
Me: My gut tells me this is probably, like, for 30 days free trial. It's probably, like, $800.
Me: In infrastructure cost would be my guess.
Me: I'd love to be proven wrong or right on that one, but knowing Kubernetes, knowing Stormforge, and how they talk about how everything needs to be super fast and readily available and spun up in a heartbeat,
Me: Always on kind of thing.
Me: I'll Bet we're spending $800 per.
Them: Per trial.
Me: Trial? That would be my guess.
Me: I'm far away from finops, but I'm telling you right now.
Me: If we're doing it on EKs, and we're doing it on fast EKs, with fast catch, with fast storage, with all that stuff. Like, the second they sign up, it's an instance is set up. The only question I don't know is do they wait?
Me: Until an incel happens.
Me: No, they don't. Right.
Me: So the second.
Them: We're going to bring that up.
Them: They might wait until something's installed.
Me: But how? Because.
Me: It's a good question. I'm just going to ask Josh right now.
Them: Pass to invoice on Credly.
Them: How's that going?
Them: Sean.
Them: We given anybody badges?
Me: All right.
Me: I feel good.
Me: I mean, couple slides, like you said. I think we need to out roll up our top concerns.
Me: And probably we need to separately talk to Brendan.
Me: Feel free to bring me into that conversation.
Me: We could talk to Keno about it.
Me: Quickly.
Me: On next week's call.
Me: As for kind of Kino's steady state around what kind of reporting he wants.
Me: I just took a swag today on.
Me: We're going to need to adapt this a little bit.
Me: But from the marketing side, obviously, all the pipeline metrics stay the same for now.
Me: And then stage four in his new world.
Me: I'm basically just putting it to prove level, right?
Me: That's kind of what it would map to in current state.
Me: Sort of.
Them: Yes.
Me: So we only have two right now that are in that category from this quarter. And then.
Me: I also am trying to do. And I'm going to have Caleb help me a little bit with this, but this is actually not true.
Me: But of the 12 opportunities that we have this quarter, we are only engaged with the director level or higher on three.
Me: And.
Them: I bet you the rumors are shit on that, too.
Them: I would imagine our date is dog shit.
Them: At that level.
Me: Actually, not necessarily. If.
Them: They put their title into the form they filled out.
Them: Like reps aren't adding titles.
Me: No, but caleb is.
Them: Contact.
Me: Caleb is.
Me: Now, if somebody came on after Caleb dropped off, then yes, but I don't think this happened on any of these.
Me: So far.
Me: And so one thing I did tell Caleb to do today.
Me: As I was. Like, you need to start getting the habit, man, of just making sure that even people that don't show up on those calls.
Me: You're coming into the opportunity.
Me: And you're updating the contacts.
Me: That are attached to that account.
Me: And making sure their titles are correct.
Me: Everything I've seen so far in the pipeline, the titles were correct.
Me: And now it was cross verifying with Gong.
Me: So I think we might be benefiting from Caleb doing some of this.
Me: But I told him to look at.
Me: This.
Me: Contacts.
Me: This is obviously a crazy example.
Me: Because this is a big account that we've worked with for a while.
Me: But come in. There's usually two or three. Just make sure that the right contacts.
Them: Yeah.
Them: That's a story.
Them: Then they need to be contact roles on the opportunity for them to associate.
Me: Yeah. Let me see if that's actually happening.
Me: So here's the op.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Okay?
Me: All right.
Me: Can. It is spun up when signup occurs, okay?
Them: Sign up occurs.
Them: Great.
Them: That's a good time to do it.
Them: That's even the level that I'd like to get to is like how expensive is it at sign up verse install.
Them: Because if it's the same cost, that's crazy.
Them: But I'd be surprised.
Them: Even still, if we get to the point where those reports that you were just showing of your ad spend, if we can just sort of create a funnel.
Them: Even if it's not perfect.
Them: Even if we don't have Josh's time.
Them: Against each of these.
Them: Or roughest time or anybody else who might be looking in this stupid user alerts.
Them: Channel.
Them: I think if we can show the hard cost versus the actual revenue.
Them: It'll tell a very clear picture.
Them: Here.
Me: Totally.
Me: And I'll bet.
Me: If you were to have one step in between where it's.
Me: Let me give an example.
Me: Of something that they wouldn't have thought of, Right? And then I got to go around and get the girl, but okay.
Me: Somebody does a sign up.
Me: You send them to a page where they have to fill out their initial information, but you send them that email.
Me: Seven minutes after.
Me: Or have them fill out something and go. Thank you. We will be sending you your information for your login in the next 10 minutes.
Me: Something that we delay the automation while the resources are being spun up after there's some gate that makes it real for them.
Me: And HubSpot can do that.
Me: Right.
Me: It. HubSpot can just time stuff.
Them: Are you talking about? What we're going to recommend coming out of us proving that we're wasting time and money.
Me: Well, actually, maybe we shouldn't even do that.
Me: Now that you said that out loud.
Me: I think we should just go. Here's the data.
Me: We have plenty of ideas.
Me: Let us know.
Them: Will result in, though. I don't know if this is the point of Ray Camps.
Them: I'm so exhausted.
Them: Today.
Them: I think we have to have our hypothesis clear. Prove it with this data.
Them: Like that.
Them: But then when everyone says. Yeah, when you put it that way.
Them: Maybe this isn't the right way to do it.
Them: We are going to have to then follow that with here's our recommendation to get better conversion out of this.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Yeah.
Me: I mean.
Them: A little bit obvious.
Them: Between you and I, at least operationally, we're going to gate this shit.
Them: Immediately.
Them: We can't have this Gmail crap coming anymore.
Me: Yeah.
Me: That'd be the first one. The second one would be like an actual onboarding experience where we're collecting more data.
Me: Which is what CAS does. They ask what organization, what's your role, all that stuff.
Me: And then I think product led information, where the product actually grabs information from you throughout it.
Me: And tries to steer you towards ctas.
Me: And then I definitely think there's something about.
Me: Hey, we noticed you haven't logged in on in the last five days. Are you still interested in this trial? And if they come back and say no, then something that emails the engineers to go tear this shit down.
Them: I think there should be some route or some recommendation to Josh or whoever the hell is rotting this to.
Them: How do we qualify? In or out? Quickly.
Them: When these come in.
Them: Like, obviously, we're trying to create top of funnel.
Them: Higher quality leads.
Them: Out of this.
Them: They're not all going to convert to revenue.
Them: How does somebody get involved quickly to identify whether.
Them: They're going to commit to a contract or go to Paygo or die.
Me: He doesn't know how long the resources stay alive.
Me: But I agree with you.
Me: I agree with you.
Me: I think we need to.
Me: Listen, at the end of the day,
Me: Both of the things we started with are going to take time anyhow, so let's start there.
Me: And then we'll come back with other things we should be doing.
Me: But at minimum, we need to be clearing out the noise.
Me: Because764instances of this costs a lot of money.
Me: And I'll bet the second you slap a what's your business email in.
Me: That goes from 764 down to 100.
Me: So I got to run. Good catching up, man.
Me: Get some sleep.
Me: And I will chat with you later this week.
Them: This isn't too important.
Them: But if you're talking to Caleb again,
Them: Hierarchy.
Them: Like product marketing.
Them: Okay?
Them: Great.
Them: But the person's LinkedIn says manager.
Them: So how do we know here at what level of product marketing this person is?
Them: You know what I mean?
Me: Would that be under role?
Me: Or.
Them: This is a contact roles. But you see how it's like manager.
Me: Just in the title.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Got it.
Them: There's also, like, here you can put.
Them: I don't even know if you can.
Them: I think that's the best way to do it right now.
Them: Is to just put.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Sure.
Me: Easy.
Them: I think we have some rarity field.
Them: But I don't think it's visible.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Man.
Me: Easy enough.
Me: Thank you so much.
Them: Anyway.
Them: But Godspeed, brother. I'll talk to you later.

<
Me: Hey, Keno. Good morning. How are you, man?
Them: William.
Them: Good morning.
Them: You're looking very pink today.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Man.
Them: I like a guy that's grounded in his masculinity.
Them: I love it.
Me: Hi. Purely masculine over here.
Them: It is.
Them: Your exuding masculinity.
Them: Does Mrs. William like that?
Me: Yeah.
Them: Did she pick that up?
Me: My first date with my wife was I wore a salmon colored. Actually, it was.
Me: It was also polo ralph lauren.
Me: You know, But I got all the colors. I got the bright spring colors.
Them: Wow.
Me: I got the. You know, I lived in new york.
Me: I went up to Boston.
Me: I had to buy the ocean kind of colors too.
Me: The bright blues and all that.
Them: Love it.
Them: What was your million dollar line that held your sweet baby's heart captive?
Them: How did you land her?
Me: She said in a sea of creeps. You were the only one that commented on my eyes.
Me: Look at that. Beautiful. Eyes out, Erin.
Me: You should see my daughter's eyes.
Me: Too.
Me: They are, like, just as pretty.
Them: She'd get Mama's eyes.
Me: Oh, yeah.
Me: Well, this is her when she was really young.
Me: But you can just see just how blue.
Me: I mean, they just cut like knives.
Them: More.
Me: And very blue.
Me: She's a lot older now.
Them: Movie. Azul. Mui azul. Love it.
Me: Like greenish bluish eyes.
Me: Just depends on the day.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Man. Hopefully you get to meet my daughter at some point.
Me: She's frickin.
Me: Dorable.
Me: Everybody's best friend.
Them: I love to hear a father gushing over his daughter.
Them: And I hope to meet your sweet baby.
Them: At some point.
Them: In the not too distant future.
Them: Remind me again where you are.
Me: I'm in raleigh. Durham.
Them: Raleigh. That's right.
Me: I was in New York for a while.
Me: I was in arizona.
Me: For a while.
Me: I was in Florida for a while.
Them: Four seasons.
Them: Love it.
Me: I'm in Raleigh. Durham now. I like it a lot down here.
Me: It's a good. It's a growing area.
Me: I was able to afford a really nice big house.
Me: And I say that just because I wasn't able to do that.
Me: In new york.
Them: Right.
Me: So I went through the grind of kind of moving up in rank and seniority and all that fun stuff.
Me: In New York, where I was just like, all the pressure against me.
Me: And then you get to a point where you're like, okay.
Me: We can afford to buy a house out here.
Me: But do we want to do that?
Me: Do we want to buy a house in New York?
Me: Or do we want to just go somewhere where it's a little bit better economic?
Them: Well, it was probably an easy decision after you weighed all the criteria.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Man.
Me: I was getting. We were thinking about Austin for a while, but that's it.
Me: Talk about a market, man. How long you been out there?
Them: You dodged the bullet.
Them: I don't like it.
Them: Here.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Yeah.
Them: It's not my kind of culture.
Them: It's hot as balls.
Them: It's crazy.
Them: Expensive.
Them: And it's hard to get places.
Them: There's not that many direct flights.
Them: For a traveling sales guy.
Them: It's not a great place to be.
Them: As soon as I only came here because my now ex wife wanted to come here and I was trying to make her happy.
Them: It was better for the kids.
Them: Education is superior.
Them: Relative to where we were, really good education.
Them: But my heart's in Atlanta.
Them: That's where my friends are. That's my family is direct flights every in the world.
Them: Reasonable cost of living. Four Seasons.
Them: Hour from the mountains.
Them: Four and a half hours from the best beach in the world.
Them: Is just so much to like.
Them: About atlanta.
Me: My favorite place in the world.
Me: Is not necessarily Atlanta, but Savannah, Georgia. It holds my heart.
Me: It always has, from the time I first went there.
Me: If I could get back to Savannah, I would.
Me: But I feel you, man. I moved here just to make my wife.
Me: Happy.
Me: I like it.
Me: Austin 11 years ago When I first went to Austin.
Me: I remember being blown away at how just unique that culture was. And then I went back seven years later, maybe, and I was like, oh, this became la. What happened?
Me: Holy shit.
Me: We went from. This is great. Don't ever lose this.
Me: Such a cool vibe.
Me: To los angeles 'texas twin.
Them: Californians invaded.
Them: Like a horde.
Them: They invaded. They took over the city.
Them: They ran out the hippies, they ran out the artists, they ran out the musicians.
Them: None of them around anymore. They can't afford to live here.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Which has made it worse.
Them: It's a great place to visit.
Them: Absolutely.
Them: Fantastic place to visit.
Them: Great restaurant scene. A lot of stuff to do, but to live, especially in the summers.
Them: It's inhumane.
Them: It's inhumane.
Them: Are we waiting on? Yeah.
Them: We are.
Them: Okay?
Them: There he is.
Me: Thank you.
Me: Join. Let me grab my coffee.
Me: Real quick.
Me: I said it in the.
Them: Now.
Them: Gentlemen.
Them: Nicholas.
Them: Howdy.
Them: Good morning.
Them: Silent few late here, this happens.
Them: Back to back. So just running into each other.
Them: This morning.
Them: You're not having a hard time.
Me: Happy to have you back.
Me: Nick.
Them: Good to be back.
Me: Now that you're back.
Me: We got to load up your calendar.
Me: Keno. You want me to kick off? Are you kicking off, man?
Them: I would like you to kick off.
Them: Because I'm not entirely sure how we're going to run this meeting.
Them: I saw your agenda.
Them: I liked it.
Them: But I would like you to drive it.
Them: And I would like to ask questions.
Me: Love it.
Me: Love it.
Them: Forever.
Me: All right.
Me: Cool.
Me: So I guess the succinct version of my message yesterday.
Me: Like Nick and I have had a couple calls.
Me: In the last week or so spent some time yesterday afternoon.
Me: The more we talked about current state of reporting and what we wanted to show you, the more we thought, well, this keynote even know what's available. Have we really gone a deep dive on how this all works in the mechanics.
Me: And then there's kind of a gap analysis of like, here's what we have today. Here's some assets you've sent over to us that we think are great.
Me: But we can kind of talk you through our model versus what we're seeing in your model.
Me: And some of the data we have some of the data we might need to maybe tweak some of the data that may just be missing right now.
Me: All in hopes to where we can get this call and other calls.
Me: Into a place where we can just start by going, hey, Kino, here's the update.
Me: Like. Here's what you want to see.
Me: And then we can do the analysis.
Me: I think, Nick, you can overlay here.
Me: But big goal for me.
Me: At the end of this call is like just you being aware of what's available.
Me: And us talking about what's good and what needs to change.
Me: So we can go do that.
Me: And then Nick's got a lot of the history on the sales and marketing stuff.
Me: That you would even plugged into marketing out before I was.
Me: So we've got a lot of data over 10 plus years in Salesforce.
Me: There's a little bit of debt that comes with that.
Me: But I think there's some really cool stuff that's available today.
Them: I like it.
Them: Let me interject before you continue.
Me: Sure.
Them: Will. Let's start with some guiding principles.
Them: So we're aligned.
Them: On what I want to get out of this meeting.
Them: And what I'm asking marketing to do on a go forward basis.
Me: Sure.
Them: Okay?
Them: Let's start with the tactical.
Them: The goal.
Them: For each and every one of the reps.
Them: On a go forward basis.
Them: Is to have at least 4x in stage 3 and above pipeline with a close date that aligns.
Them: With the fiscal year.
Them: So quotas a million. You got to have at least 4 million in stage three and above. And if you're not familiar with the stages, we're going to be rolling that out.
Them: Shortly, but in our new and improved sales stages.
Them: Every stage is going to be binary.
Them: It's going to abstract the need or absolve, rather, the need for a rep or anybody in marketing to determine what stage the deal is at.
Them: Every one of the criteria is binary.
Them: You've done the demo or you haven't. You've met with the economic buyer. You have it. You've done the POC or you haven't. So stage three and above is where pipeline deals start becoming meaningful.
Them: My model, and that is something I want to over index on. Anything that's below Stage three, I don't really want to talk about except for why they're not converting to Stage three.
Them: That's what's going to be meaningful.
Them: To me.
Them: That's the first one.
Them: Second, I want to emphasize quantity.
Them: Equality.
Them: Over quantity.
Them: I will trade one meeting at the VP level and above for four meanings at the below.
Them: The vp meeting.
Them: So I want us to emphasize. I know this. I'm asking a lot.
Them: I know this.
Them: But it's an aspirational goal.
Them: I want us to collectively focus all of our demand gen efforts.
Them: Marketing as well as non marketing.
Them: I want them focus, to penetrate at more senior levels in the organization.
Them: Which might change where we make our marketing related investments.
Them: On a go forward basis.
Them: I am trying to get out of the activity for the sake of activity of business. I also understand and recognize that we only hold out for sea level meetings.
Them: We'll never make our numbers.
Them: So those are the two competing ends.
Them: That I want to come up with a strategy between us.
Them: To solve for it.
Them: I want higher quality meetings.
Them: And I'll take fewer meetings.
Them: And I will ensure that the reps will actively and aggressively pursue those meetings.
Them: So that's what I want to solve for. Clear on the charter, clear on what I'm asking for.
Them: It's clear to me.
Them: Will. My initial reaction was that last point sort of impacts the storm. Forge go to market mostly, and I think you've indexed for that.
Me: Pretty significantly.
Me: Yeah.
Them: On our. Yeah, I'm sorry.
Them: Caveat to everything I just said.
Them: I think Stormforge has to be handled a little bit differently.
Them: And before we get into it,
Them: Do not read anything into this.
Them: I'm just gathering information.
Them: I'm simply gathering. I'm map making any decisions.
Them: But I'm curious to get your both opinions.
Them: How would you feel if we were to convert Josh, if he's even amenable to it?
Them: Again.
Them: I haven't decided this.
Them: But if we were to make him exclusively stormforge and he gets every Storm Forge opportunity and all the stormforge opportunities are his. Or he's an overlay and we split comp. Anything and everything is on the table.
Them: Just spitball and give me your impression.
Them: Is that better for the company?
Them: Overall.
Them: Not as good.
Them: Just share your opinions with me.
Me: Do you mind if we hold that just for the side for one second?
Me: So I can react to the first couple things you brought up.
Them: Yes.
Me: Sorry.
Me: Because I do want to talk about that.
Me: Thoughts.
Me: Stage three or above. What stage three?
Them: Nikki. You got it.
Them: Demo.
Me: Demo, okay?
Them: Demo.
Me: I like that.
Them: For us right now.
Me: That is.
Them: It's like, effectively, discovery. So our stage two now.
Me: Very doable.
Me: I like that. That's the stage we're talking about. Everything else on that.
Me: Point made sense.
Me: Quality over quantity.
Me: Totally depends on go to market.
Me: So glad that Nick brought up stormforge. I think we should also talk about some other go to markets where.
Me: Your EB might be a VP or higher, but like champion usually isn't. So like Finops I think is a really good example.
Me: Of that.
Me: An ops titles are usually senior managers.
Me: They're not VPs. But you absolutely want to be talking to the FinOps leader.
Me: First.
Me: And foremost, they're the ones chartered with the project.
Me: The subject matter experts and they've got the EB behind them. Usually when we have a conversation like they're already no.
Them: I respectfully disagree with you.
Them: And I'll explain to you why.
Them: And this will all make sense when we all go through training in a couple of weeks.
Them: The first person that you have a conversation with has profound implications for the speed and the conversion rate of the deal.
Them: So when you start with the kind of person that you're describing, Will, the difference between the two approaches is really rooted in just a couple of things.
Them: If I start with larry low level marvin, mid level manager.
Them: Or Arnold the ankle biter.
Them: When I start with that person.
Them: I am asking him or her to take on the risk that the economic buyer may or may not sanction this project.
Them: I'm asking him to risk his reputation because he simply doesn't know how the higher level people are going to interpret this.
Them: Now, when I start with the economic buyer.
Them: And I sell him or her on a process.
Them: And he picks up the phone.
Them: And says, hey, Frankie.
Them: I just saw something interesting.
Them: I'd like you to dig in.
Them: Two beautiful thing happened.
Them: Two beautiful things happen that radically alter the momentum of the deal.
Them: First of all, Frankie knows.
Them: That this is an important project.
Them: So the need to sell it up the line or risk his or her reputation is eliminated.
Them: It's been saying from the get go and then second, and this is foundational to the champion construct.
Them: And the way you guys have been using the term champion is going to be 180 degrees than what it's going to be used in two weeks.
Them: Because the most important part of the sales process, you have just created a selfish personal win that is foundational to the champion construct.
Them: No selfishness, no champion.
Them: The champion needs something selfish.
Them: And you've just given that person an opportunity to deliver on something that the man or the woe man thinks is important.
Them: So all that to say? I do want to talk to the champion.
Them: But not on the first conversation.
Them: I want the man to pick up the phone.
Them: And say, frankie.
Them: I want you to take a look at this.
Them: Then I want to go talk to Frankie.
Them: If I talk to frankie first.
Them: I'm 100% dependent on Frankie having the chops.
Them: The understanding, the political clout.
Them: And the willingness to go take it up the line.
Them: And my chances of conversion plummet in that scenario.
Them: Plummet.
Them: So the answer is we need both.
Them: But I want more of the executive level conversations.
Them: And I'll settle.
Them: We're starting with Frankie. When we've exhausted.
Them: Getting to the man.
Them: As our first initial step. Question Comments.
Me: Sure.
Them: Disagreements.
Them: This is a safe space.
Me: Yeah.
Me: I mean, I guess just reaction is then, I want your partnership and thought leadership. I'm like, let's go look at some examples of inbounds and how we would like, how we would run each.
Me: Is. Well, maybe that. Step back and step up for a second.
Me: Are you talking about? Hey, when we're targeting folks.
Me: We want to target above, but when we get an inbound, we're not filtering out? Or is there some process that's intermediate? Like if you get a finops person who's not an economic buyer, not a vp.
Them: Yes.
Me: Is Caleb handling the first call and maybe not the field or how are we saying no?
Them: Great question.
Them: Great question.
Them: Great question.
Them: So I should have delineated between the two fundamental sales motions that will be undertaking on a go forward basis.
Them: Sales motion A, which is the one that I was describing, is outbound and meeting orchestration.
Them: Okay?
Them: Get me meetings. However, you have to pay to play content syndication. Leveraging insight.
Them: I don't give a. Get me meetings with the man. That's outbound sales motion.
Them: Sales motion number two, which is very appropriate for what you're saying. Well, is the customer is either already in the market or interest has been cultivated.
Them: And now we've been approached.
Them: We can't ignore that person. So we're going to have a different sales motion for that.
Me: Yeah.
Them: It's going to be just a long story short. Get information, qualify it.
Them: And then the first one is on us.
Them: Whatever it is.
Them: Demo reference, whatever.
Them: First one's on us after that.
Them: We ain't doing fucking shit.
Them: Until you can give me a path to get to the man in short order. And if you ain't willing to do it,
Them: Fuck you and your inbound lead. Thank you very much.
Them: Have a good day.
Them: There's 20 other jamotes in this company.
Them: In this country to get paid.
Them: To give you demos, and you need to go dance with them.
Them: I am going to see activity plummeting, and I'm going to see conversion rate skyrocketing.
Them: So we're going to do both. But I'm asking you to instrument orchestrate. Propose a plan that gets me a significant number of my meetings through outbound at senior levels.
Them: In the organization.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Got it.
Me: Okay?
Them: Partners pay for play, content, syndication, buy the meetings.
Them: Events. I want to meet more with the man.
Them: Than this company has been doing.
Them: A lot more.
Them: They're not meeting with the man.
Them: They're meeting with Larry Low level. Over and over and over again.
Them: That's a hard sale, man.
Them: You got seven levels.
Them: That can kill you.
Them: Along the way.
Them: But when you start with the man,
Them: You win fast or you lose fast.
Them: Both of them are good.
Them: I'm off my soapbox.
Me: Now makes time sense.
Me: Nick anything from you.
Them: I clarity.
Them: No, that clarity was necessary.
Them: And I think the outbound process is something that can drastically improve our success and opportunity for success that we are not doing right now.
Me: Yeah.
Them: This is going to be asked of everybody.
Them: The partner organization, the reps themselves.
Them: The bdrs.
Them: And marketing.
Them: Everybody is going to be. I'm asking everybody.
Them: Become more focused and more attuned on elevating first meetings with senior level executives.
Me: I think. Oh, go ahead.
Them: I was just going to ask if you're good there.
Them: If you want to move to Josh for a second.
Me: One final thing that I'll just throw out there.
Me: And Nick. This is something maybe we could bring. This is why I think the first few calls.
Me: Kino are going to be exploratory like this.
Me: Just because we need to get you up to speed and maybe for current state.
Me: If you look at net new business.
Me: Breakdown for just even. Just this fiscal year.
Me: A lot of it is marketing sourced.
Me: An insignificant amount of sales source opportunity when you just look at revenue dollars.
Me: Channel.
Me: Very low. Not. Certainly not firing on all the cylinders it has in the past.
Me: And if you look at the marketing part of the pie,
Me: A good amount of that is organic.
Me: It's people coming in and saying hand raisers. Hey, I want to see your product. I'm interested.
Me: So we need to make that shift.
Them: Not surprised.
Me: And so I think everything you just talked about with Outbound sounds like you've run some really successful plays in the past.
Me: I'm all ears. And I want to be your partner on that.
Me: Because.
Me: We've tried a lot of things.
Me: There's a lot of room for growth there.
Me: So current state.
Me: It's a lot of people saying, hey, I want a demo.
Me: Hey, I want to talk to your team.
Me: Which is great.
Them: No problem.
Me: We got plenty of coverage. When you look at the goals that we've set out with Brendan and others,
Me: But to your point.
Me: It is a lot of mid level. Right. It's not always going to be the types of buyers we want.
Me: And then I think as we talk about marketing strategy,
Me: I'm the orchestrator of that.
Me: So if we want to go higher level, great, let's do it.
Them: I do.
Me: Those are changes I can make.
Them: I don't want to abandon the other piece because I said we need it all.
Them: If you do nothing but elephant hunt, you're going to shit the bed one quarter, you're going to crush it the next.
Them: There's no predictability in the business.
Them: That's bad.
Them: If we go strictly with Larry low level, it's going to take us forever.
Them: We're never going to achieve our goals.
Them: The answer is not ever.
Them: On the extremes.
Them: It's somewhere in between.
Them: So I am asking for a strategy.
Them: That will over emphasize.
Them: At least 50% of our meetings.
Them: Okay?
Them: Fine.
Them: A 35% of our meetings to be at the VP level or above. That's what I'm asking for.
Them: That's aspirational.
Them: As far as the stuff that you're talking about. Well, we're not going to abandon that.
Them: We're not going to abandon that at all.
Them: What we are going to do differently.
Them: Is qualify out very quickly.
Them: And we're going to negotiate the sales cycle.
Them: From the get go, not just the deal.
Them: We're going to negotiate the path forward again. First one's on us.
Them: You want to demo, no problem.
Them: Larry.
Them: I'll give you a demo.
Them: But don't fucking ask for another thing.
Them: Until you're going to put me in front of the man.
Them: And we're going to talk about sanctioning and evaluation.
Them: Plain and simple. There's the Alabama version.
Me: I think. I'm not going to speak for Nick, but I think we probably both love it.
Them: We're on the same page.
Them: There.
Them: And all I'll do is overlay something. Will said you'll notice our sales source opportunities.
Them: Are almost entirely not new business.
Them: They're like upsell of an already sourced opportunity.
Them: Or their customer success working with their current customer.
Them: Called sales source. So they're not the category that you're talking about, where we're identifying an EB that might not be inbound to us in engagement already.
Me: Yeah.
Me: And that'll be just for the field.
Me: Because I think Steve was basically going, hey, we'll focus on outbound, maybe Q4, maybe Q1.
Me: Like we're just not there yet.
Them: We don't have time for that.
Them: Ever.
Me: Tried to fight that battle, Nick and I, and it just was deaf ears.
Them: Well, again, this is a safe space.
Them: Have very strong opinions.
Them: But I'm very easy to persuade you.
Them: Want to beat me? You want to change my mind?
Them: It's very simple.
Them: Data.
Me: Oh, no.
Them: Give me data.
Me: We agree.
Them: Inform me now. Just give me data. Until you can give me data that you're not going to change my mind very successfully.
Them: I think our data right now aligns to almost all of the things you've just said.
Me: Exactly.
Them: So that's why Will and I are smiling and we're like, yeah.
Them: We're on board with that.
Them: I love the way you're cursing, too, because I've got a potty mouth.
Them: Yeah.
Them: Let's go.
Them: Get it out.
Them: I can go with my potty mouth.
Them: Yeah.
Them: How strong is HR at this company?
Them: One person.
Them: So as long as we keep.
Me: You don't know their name?
Them: Jesse off these calls.
Them: And we'll be fine.
Them: That's right.
Me: Okay?
Them: I got to try to dial it back.
Me: Let's talk about Josh.
Me: So let me give you the kind of quick summary version. I'm sure Nick will have some points.
Me: We acquired Stormforge.
Me: We essentially learned, okay?
Me: They've got a product focused strategy where they're routing pretty much everything to a free trial.
Me: Right.
Me: Free trial, and I'll send you an entire analysis I did on this.
Me: Nick and I were on the front end of this when we were doing Discovery before the acquisition to try to take their go to market motion and adapt it to ours.
Me: And what we found is, like, largely, they're not asking for a lot.
Me: They're targeting engineers.
Me: They're asking for any email address and password.
Me: And then they're just letting people directly onto the product.
Them: So they're all hiding behind Gmails.
Them: Is the point there.
Me: Yes.
Me: And the problem that we had on our end is, okay.
Me: We can't do anything.
Me: With this information.
Me: Right? Because it's just a Gmail. There's no organization. We can't find them on LinkedIn.
Me: What we found is essentially, Josh was using a Slack channel that's called User Alerts or something like that.
Them: Yes.
Me: I bear you. I won't add you to this channel.
Me: Because it's just a whole bunch of noise.
Me: But you see the kinds of things that are coming in. It's a lot of either current customers.
Me: Or a lot of gmails or a lot of edus or a lot of made up things.
Me: And what would happen is Josh would go into this channel.
Me: And he would try to correlate whatever email address he just got with something from LinkedIn sales nav. A lot of times that didn't work.
Me: I'd say most of the times that didn't work. But when he could find somebody, he'd go reach out and try to get on the phone with them.
Me: Meanwhile, they had access to a free trial.
Me: We had a lot of qualms.
Me: With this.
Me: I went out and I did a whole analysis of some of the competitors that stormforge had, and I said, this isn't even best practice in this part of the market.
Me: Like, if you look at cast AI right now,
Me: They're not allowing any email address. They require an organization email address or like a GitHub link where you can do some sort of correlation.
Me: They're asking you what your name is. They're asking you what organization, they're asking your title.
Me: All as a part of the onboarding experience.
Me: That gives marketing more to work on.
Me: We didn't find a happy medium there.
Me: Nothing changed.
Me: So right now, what essentially we've done is we said, hey, we're not going to call these marketing qualified leads.
Me: We are just going to bring them in as contacts.
Me: And we will start a nurture campaign.
Me: In HubSpot that basically says if a Gmail comes in, once they get on the product, we're going to start sending them emails that try to convert them into some sales motion.
Me: We also said to Josh, hey, Josh, we're not going to go to the field and tell them to do the same kind of thing you're doing right now.
Me: So keep running.
Me: It.
Me: If you want to be in this user alerts thing.
Me: And go find these folks.
Me: We will do that.
Me: And then if anybody converts in these emails,
Me: That we're sending out, we're going to go ahead and align it to you.
Me: So you can have that initial conversation.
Me: And I believe Nick, this is where you're going to need to correct me or keep me honest.
Me: Is he has that first conversation, he brings in the account executive that would oversee that account, and then there's some sharing of that opportunity between Josh and the rep that would take it.
Me: So I give you all that context, and I'm sure Nick will give you more, because essentially, that's what's happening right now.
Me: Like Josh is on the front end of every net new business stormforge opportunity that we have.
Me: That source, at least from marketing. Nick, I don't know if that's different in any other way.
Them: It's true.
Them: And it sort of then converges with something that I've said to you a couple days, I don't know.
Them: They're all the same days.
Them: Like a week ago.
Them: Where there was this shared ownership of things.
Them: Or to your point, keynote. Maybe Josh is just the new business stormforge guy.
Them: That's not clear right now.
Them: It's Josh. You do all the work and spend all your time, and then you have to share this responsibility or pass it off to somebody.
Them: Similarly with the West Charter.
Them: Josh is our west territory rep.
Them: But then was told, well, you don't really own the West. Shashir still does. And you can share some of the responsibility.
Them: What that has led to is nobody's taking ownership and responsibility and really driving the appropriate action.
Them: And therefore we're wasting a lot of time or wasting at bats because the lead will go to Shashir and then he does nothing.
Them: And then Josh is asking Shashir.
Them: Hey, can I work this?
Them: And then Shashir says, nope, I got this.
Them: But three months have gone by and Shashir hasn't done anything with it.
Them: So they sort of converges with, like, Josh's feeling that I'm not getting enough opportunity to work on.
Them: More directly to answer your point.
Them: I would feel comfortable with something like Josh, you are very clearly west, and you'll have all those opportunities.
Them: And if that's not enough,
Them: Yes.
Them: You are the new business Stormforge guy.
Them: The reason I say it that way is I think there is some gray area where maybe Samantha has a current customer that's interested in Stormforge.
Them: Do we distract Josh with that, or is Samantha at a level where she can sell stormforge to her existing customer base?
Them: That she's already working on.
Them: All great context and great backstory.
Them: Thanks.
Them: Guys.
Them: I appreciate that.
Them: Nick, before I forget, that lead that you assigned me yesterday, can you go ahead and assign that to Callum?
Them: And copy me on it.
Them: Please.
Them: The email. Just before I forget.
Them: So let's start with the demand gen approach is a healthy discussion.
Them: I like this discussion.
Them: And a couple of proposals.
Them: And then we'll shift the gears and talk some more about Josh.
Them: I understand why the motion has been architected.
Them: Because I saw this firsthand when we were at platform nine.
Them: The developer is kind of a unique game.
Them: Right.
Them: They don't like salespeople.
Them: They don't like to be touched.
Them: They want to play with shit.
Them: And I'm not interested in talking to the guys.
Them: That want to play with shit.
Them: I'm cool with them playing because they'll be in the market a year from now.
Them: Two years from now.
Them: So I don't want to stop.
Them: That.
Them: Motion getting it in the hands.
Them: Of as many developers playing with it. I don't want to stop that.
Them: What I do want that I think might be a tweener and curious to get your thoughts.
Them: What if anybody can play with it?
Them: We get them pregnant.
Them: But then if you want to play with it longer or you want some level of support, then you have to put in your company email address under the auspices of getting more than just a temporary sandbox or whatever it is that you get.
Them: That doesn't prevent us from getting the groundswell that will lead to pipeline for kubernetes down the road. And again, it's a different animal.
Them: Than than rest of the pieces of the portfolio.
Them: We don't eliminate that.
Them: But we focus, whether it's just Josh or all the reps on a higher level of qualification because they can't engage further without the skin in the game that we want.
Them: Their corporate email address and whatever the information the cast AI is asking for, or whatever it is that you think would be a best practice.
Them: This fits very nicely under my edict that I want fewer opportunities.
Them: But I want better qualified opportunities.
Them: Thoughts.
Them: I have an initial reaction as you model there.
Them: Will. I think if we can architect it the right way.
Them: I think one of the things it would solve is, like, the very specific point Will had. Like, Josh is spending a lot of time trying to identify the developer and turn that into qualification, where we pay Josh a lot of money.
Them: That's a waste.
Them: We want you to hide that channel.
Them: Completely.
Them: And only react when our architected rework of this sends you a here's somebody who's actually giving you enough detail to say that they're in a buying motion.
Them: Yes.
Them: That's what I'm proposing.
Them: So the quantities, but the people that are left.
Them: Are clearly qualified.
Them: It's not, say they're ready to buy or anything like that.
Them: But we shouldn't be chasing down and trying to even figure out in these fucking gmail jamokes are because 80% of them.
Them: Are. See more, seymour.
Them: That you just want to play with shit.
Them: That's not prospect.
Them: I'm talking a little because I don't have the architecture clear in my mind.
Them: Yet.
Them: Nor I don't think you would expect me to have this completely figured out upon reaction.
Them: But I'm bringing in another thought here, which I think applies.
Them: And I'll give you too much context.
Them: For a minute.
Them: But part of this nurture we have going on and part of the stormforge motion is the pay as you go model.
Them: Right.
Them: I agree.
Them: I hear your reaction, which is why I'm bringing it up here.
Them: One of the things that we have not built a good strategy around and therefore haven't implemented a process for is fine, send some low level shit to pay as you go.
Them: But then how do we identify the paygo customer that's ready and willing to come out of that model and actually commit ARR to us?
Them: Right now.
Them: We said, oh, just let everybody go to Paygo. What that has actually created is we have forecasted opportunities like Iris, where we were forecasting a commitment.
Them: And they backed out, and they're like, I'm just going to go to PayGo for now. And now we don't have any committed revenue out of that.
Them: How much money did we drive ARR in paygo since the inception?
Them: Of. Of the program.
Them: We have no ARR. Out of paygo. How much revenue?
Them: I don't know specifically. I think it was about four accounts total.
Them: It's only been running for a few months.
Them: I would imagine. Whatever. Call it one time revenue.
Them: Is 10,000 maybe it's very low.
Me: It's not that much.
Me: Or small.
Them: None of them have converted to ARR customers.
Them: Zero. Correct.
Them: Zero.
Them: That sounds like a bad bet. That sounds like a bad thing.
Them: And why I bring it up here because I think that sort of converges in that qualification conversation. Like, we have the person in the trial that's coming up and we're spending way too much time, people, resources, trying to qualify them.
Them: We also have the motion of we'll just send things to Paygo, but then never put a motion into fine.
Them: Get those logos. Maybe we can make a story out of that.
Them: Where we have thousands of customers.
Them: And a bunch of them are Paygill. But how do we get those Paygo people out of that motion and into committed revenue?
Them: Nobody's really talked about that.
Them: In a structured manner.
Them: That's why I bring up.
Them: What do you think?
Them: Will. We've been doing a lot of talking. What do you think?
Me: Yes.
Me: I have a lot of thoughts.
Me: My top level thought just with 25 minutes left is like the biggest opportunities that we have right now.
Me: Are not really storm forage related, but there's a lot unanswered questions.
Me: For the store Forge go to market. So I think maybe we should have another call about this at some point in time, but probably not the most important for us.
Me: Problems.
Me: Set for us to solve.
Me: I have a gut opinion about product led growth as well as like an informed gone to conferences, listened to people that know this stuff really well.
Me: Opinions on go to market for product led growth. There's a sandbox that's available. I agree. Kino, the people that are engineers that just want to kick the tires.
Me: We don't really want to be in front of them either.
Me: But when we start standing up, really expensive and fast ephemeral resources.
Me: That come out of our cloud budget.
Me: For 30 days.
Me: And then a significant. I could give you a number, a significant amount of people that stand up that free trial.
Me: Don't ever actually log in, and all we got from them is a fake Gmail address.
Me: We are losing money and the value exchange is not fair.
Them: Good point.
Me: So in my eyes.
Me: And I've said this to all of us. To refer to again, deaf ear is not. I don't want to. I don't want to rehash this, but engineers want to go kick the tire.
Me: Go jump in the sandbox. It's available.
Me: Right.
Me: If you want value from us.
Me: We expect baseline amount of things.
Me: My thoughts on the marketing MQL is we need your name.
Me: We need your organization.
Me: We need your organizational email address. It's as simple as that.
Me: If you want to go play around, fine. We won't bother you.
Me: But that's table stakes in my mind.
Me: And if you're not willing to give that, we don't really want to be engaging with you either.
Me: Right.
Me: Like you have solution briefs and you've got a sandbox, and you got all these videos you can go watch on YouTube.
Me: Like you can go get a sense of how our product works.
Me: But the problem with the product keynote in the free trial is that it's unfettered access.
Me: I mean, they can go download it on a cluster.
Me: Save a ton of money, walk away, and we don't even know who they are.
Me: Right.
Me: And so I challenge that model not because I think it's going to create a windfall.
Me: Of opportunities.
Me: But at least gives. Josh. Hey, you've got three engineers.
Me: At Equifax who are playing around with this.
Me: They're spreading word around everybody.
Me: You got six people in one company.
Me: Using this.
Me: Go talk to the vp.
Me: Right, Go talk to the cio. Go talk to the IT infrastructure lead.
Me: And tell them, hey, you got 60 year engineers using our product.
Me: We should have a conversation.
Me: I don't have any ability to do that.
Me: Right now.
Me: So I'll get off my soapbox.
Them: You don't have any ability to do that.
Them: Because of policy, because of the structure, because of an edit.
Me: Because they're ghost people. All we know is 7, 8, 9.
Them: Why don't you believe.
Them: I'm sorry. I'm not asking the right question.
Me: Oh, yeah.
Them: If we deployed the model that you're suggesting. Well, what would preclude you from doing that?
Me: There would be nothing.
Them: Okay?
Me: We should absolutely go.
Them: Who made the decision who made the decision to put in place the process as it is today?
Them: The gmail.
Me: We brought it on with the acquisition.
Me: We challenged it.
Me: And we got a whole bunch of pushback as to why we change that.
Them: Yasmin. Yasmin. I'll just say names.
Them: So Yasmin likes the Gmail model.
Them: And does she know about the conversion rates or the incremental pipeline?
Me: Yes.
Them: Or does she know about all that?
Them: I'm going to go talk to her.
Them: But what is her reasoning for the model as it's currently set up?
Me: Our number. According to her, our number one.
Me: Competition is open source.
Me: And the types of people that we talk to don't want to talk to sellers, and they don't want to give away their information.
Me: And that is what we went on for a while until I said, you know what? Let me take a few hours of my night.
Me: With some whiskey in hand and go look at how Cast AI is doing it and Kube Cost is doing it and all these other enterprise solutions that are doing better than us.
Me: In market.
Me: How are they doing it?
Me: I went and signed up for a bunch of trials.
Me: And what I found is that's not true.
Me: We are the only one out there.
Me: That I know of.
Me: In the mix, right?
Me: Who's not asking for anything.
Me: And giving away a bunch of value.
Me: And I just forwarded you the email. I wrote it all up and said, hey, I think there's a lot we can learn from these other guys.
Me: I challenge this notion that we can't be doing these things.
Me: And nobody responded.
Me: Right.
Me: So again, I don't think stormforge is the one go to market. We should solve on this call, but we should go back to that.
Me: Because right now there's a lot of questions of, like, why don't we have more opportunities with stormforge?
Me: Well, we're putting a lot of paid dollars in advertisement.
Me: A lot of outreach, a lot of everything that we're doing. We're running people to a free trial where they don't have to give us anything.
Me: And then that free trial. A lot of what we can do, we're sending them to a marketplace.
Me: That's a black funnel.
Me: It's a dark funnel.
Me: I have no idea.
Me: If marketing actually got somebody from an ad, put them into a free trial, and they convert it on Marketplace.
Me: I have no attribution.
Me: Right.
Me: And I'm not trying to be selfish.
Me: I'm trying to help the company, but I also want to know, is anything working?
Me: Because we're throwing thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars every quarter towards stormforge marketing.
Me: And I don't know where it goes.
Them: We're not getting any kind of an ROI on our marketing spend for stormforged.
Them: And it sounds like not only are we not getting an roi,
Them: We're generating a whole bunch of low probability activities that are consuming the likes of Josh and not having any success moving it up the value chain.
Them: Is that right?
Me: Correct.
Me: We sent 1,000 emails.
Me: For signups in the last three months, and I would say we've had one MQL.
Them: Okay?
Them: I like numbers.
Them: I like data. It's easy to change my mind.
Them: That's all you got to do.
Them: That data streams.
Them: Screams.
Them: Like you said, we're not going to solve that on this call today. I got some homework to do. I got some detective work to do. I've got some cajoling to do.
Them: But. But do I hear you both correctly?
Them: In that you are proposing that we abandon the current model.
Them: We abandon pay go. And we adopt a model that is commensurate with what our top competitors are doing.
Me: I don't have any challenges on pay goes specifically. That'd be the one thing I'd strike. But I would say my recommendations would be go look at how CAST AI runs their free trial. They require, if you're going to use a Gmail, they require to be an organizational account. I would start there.
Me: I would start there.
Me: And then the sign in experience if you go again.
Me: You can do this right now. With Cast AI. When you first log in, what's your name?
Me: What's your title?
Me: Where do you work?
Me: Like baseline information for us to put into HubSpot so we can go. Hey, Josh. Go, Bulldog. Into this company.
Me: And you got Larry low level, to use Keno's terms. Go find his boss's boss and tell him, hey, you got people using our platform.
Me: You want to talk?
Them: My only commentary is maybe not strike the paygo thing.
Them: But definitely define a better sales process around it.
Them: It can be fine for capturing a very low opportunity, low revenue.
Them: Market that we don't want to spend sales resources on.
Me: Y.
Them: But how do we use that to also then create committed revenue through our sales resources?
Them: That was always thought of. It was never defined in a way that we can actually pull an iris out of Paygo and get them committed.
Me: Eah.
Them: What is the volume of kubernetes spend there? That maybe becomes the threshold that now we go approach them.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I assume that Stormforge was doing it.
Them: This way.
Them: This suboptimal way.
Them: Way before the acquisition.
Me: Yes.
Them: Do we have any insight on what their conversion rates before Cloudvolt? I'm trying to determine is something changed when became part of Cloudbolt that caused a precipitate or it was shitty conversion.
Them: The shit was happening.
Them: Before. The only change was Pago was officially implemented post acquisition.
Them: Okay?
Me: And payo and Marketplace.
Me: Are great, great go to market strategies for a product a point solution like stormforge.
Them: Yes.
Me: Right.
Me: We just need to optionalize them.
Me: In a way that makes sense.
Me: Like right now. What happens when somebody adds it to their AWS account?
Me: Do we have customer success like running at it?
Me: That's what you do when you're talking about marketplace leg opportunities.
Me: You take that and you go. Okay. We've got a seed deal.
Me: Now we got to grow and make that valuable.
Me: So we can get more of the infrastructure share.
Me: Not happening right now.
Them: So what I'm hearing is nobody takes exception to PayGo, even though the conversion rates haven't been great.
Them: It's not more expensive to run it than it is.
Them: Revenues that we might be able to get in the foreseeable future.
Them: I want to make sure I'm hearing it.
Them: Right.
Them: Is that what I'm hearing?
Them: I have not done the analysis on cost to run those paygo instances.
Them: Revenue we get out of them.
Them: Okay?
Them: I would like to know. That's a fair data point.
Them: I would like to know that.
Them: And the second thing that I'm hearing is where sounds like in violent agreement.
Them: That the Gmail shit needs to end.
Them: And that you can't get access to a free trial unless you're willing to sign up with your corporate email.
Them: Is that what I'm hearing?
Me: And I would go a step further and go, if you want to touch the sandbox, I'd love to have a Gmail in front of that.
Me: But let's not boil the ocean.
Them: I'm sorry.
Them: I'm not following.
Them: What's the difference between the free trial in the sandbox?
Them: What's the difference between.
Me: Sandbox is hosted online.
Me: Anybody can go here. I'll show. I'll just.
Them: It's like our data and it's just a link to a sandbox that anybody can enter. As opposed to the free trial is something where they get hands on product where they can their clusters.
Them: So then a tweener would you would support Sandbox for Gmail for Sandbox but a free trial corporate email address keep Paygo as is that the proposal.
Me: Right now. This is even open.
Me: Right.
Me: So. And in between would be? We just keep this open.
Me: Even though there's so many other companies that block this behind a gate and at least go, who are you?
Me: But if we want to keep this open, that's fine.
Me: This is my challenge.
Me: Too.
Me: Well, engineers don't want to give information.
Me: Well, if they don't want to give information, go play with the free sandbox that's live on the web.
Me: Like, just let them go play with that.
Me: The other thing. Just. What? One more maybe point?
Me: I have asked and I have not received. How much does a free trial cost us to run? Because, as I understand it,
Me: The cost of the infrastructure that we're spending out for a free trial is not cheap.
Me: Like we're running it on hot, readily available, super quick.
Me: Don't burn the customer experience infrastructure.
Me: And if you think about just looking at the data that I have and that Nick has, because we did a lot of work on this,
Me: The amount of people that sign up that don't ever log in, I mean, I guarantee we are burning a lot of money.
Me: On people that don't even get the value of even touching the product.
Me: Right.
Them: I like the way you guys are thinking. I'm aligned with it.
Them: And I agree with your assessments.
Them: That is not comprehensively informed.
Them: Opinion. I would love to hear the arguments.
Them: From Yasmin. Why maintain the status quo? But I want to tackle this issue.
Them: And short of her representing very good business.
Them: Related answer to those questions.
Them: I'm going to advocate.
Them: For this proposed new world.
Them: Order.
Them: Which to me makes a lot more sense.
Them: But I got to give her her day in court.
Them: I want to hear why we should. Why should we should keep it. I know Yasmin's got strong opinions.
Them: But let's see if she can back up the truck.
Them: Maybe illuminate me is something that's missing from this discussion.
Them: So let's table that. Let's also table the Josh conversation, because what we decide to do with this will have implications for whether or not we charter Josh with something different.
Me: Yeah.
Them: But back to the original charter for this call.
Them: It's clear to both of you what I want to get out of it.
Them: Can I ask you two to re architect the agenda?
Them: To address my concerns.
Them: If it needs to be.
Them: Rearchitected.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Absolutely.
Them: I want to know how we're going to drive stage three and above. Pipeline for X for each route.
Them: I want to know that.
Them: Now I want to know what our plan is.
Them: In our cadence is going to be to constantly monitor the progress that we're making toward meetings.
Them: At the VP level and above is my ask4.
Me: Got it.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Have you seen the dashboards that exist right now?
Me: In some of the metrics that we're looking at consistently.
Me: Okay?
Me: Not moving away from the answer is unequivocally yes.
Me: We definitely can do that.
Me: But I do think. Nick, do you want to share your screen?
Me: Maybe we show flash up like the metrics we've been tracking on the marketing side.
Me: And just as the exec team looks at. And then I think there's a filter on this, that or maybe some new views that directly correlate to what you're asking for. Like, in the next session, we can just have.
Them: And I think some of this you have actually seen Keynote. I just don't know how far into detail we've gone.
Them: This dashboard. I know you've seen.
Them: Because I think you sent it to me.
Them: I think some of the things you're talking about, though, ignore the stage names for now. Discovery is essentially like, we've done the demo.
Them: Are the things you can instantly see with a chart like this.
Them: Is we have $10 million of open pipeline sitting in Discovery.
Them: Overlaid with an average stage duration, showing that things are sitting in this stage.
Them: For over 200 days.
Them: Preposterous.
Them: Absolutely.
Them: Insane.
Them: When you take that a level deeper, you start to see that to your point about activity, there's a lack of it.
Them: And these things are sitting here with no follow up post demo.
Them: That's why I like my sales stages better.
Them: Yeah.
Them: That can't happen.
Them: Right.
Them: Like, if you've completed the demo and you did not send them a follow up, you did not attempt to get a next call on the calendar on that demo.
Them: You're not doing your job.
Them: And the model that I want on a go forward basis, guys.
Them: Is. You got 30 days to progress the opportunity.
Them: If you haven't progressed it in 30 days, or you can't provide a very good reason for why it should remain open in that particular stage.
Them: Then the call to action is for you to close it out.
Them: Or move it to nurture.
Them: Either one.
Them: But I don't want it to remain.
Them: In our open pipeline.
Them: Without demonstrable progress.
Them: Agreed to next steps and reps actively closing for the next step in my nine stage sales process.
Them: Well, I took a paper note, but let's take a mental note as well.
Them: For one of our next meetings.
Them: The point about nurture there. I thought we had some nurtures going on, but I want to review that with you.
Them: Because I know to my point before Shashir closes everything as customer went silent and what that really means.
Them: Is Shashir didn't follow up with them.
Them: In time.
Them: And we should be nurturing those to make sure they come back to us.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Yeah.
Them: We can always open it back up, right?
Them: When we start getting traction.
Them: But it's misrepresenting.
Them: My pipeline to have opportunities.
Them: Like that.
Them: It's inflating.
Them: The pipeline.
Them: This is one of the reasons we only look at stage three.
Them: And above because.
Them: All the stuff that goes along without being answered.
Them: Should be happening.
Them: In stage one and two.
Them: We don't have much time.
Them: So I'm going to sort of brief this at a high level.
Them: If it makes sense.
Them: Stop me.
Them: If this is not valuable.
Them: Keynote.
Them: Okay?
Them: Nick, I'm sorry.
Them: Before you go there.
Them: I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Them: But a lot of these are getting stuck after the demo. You do the demo and then they go dark.
Them: Correct.
Me: Correct.
Them: Okay?
Them: I'm going to amend what I said earlier.
Them: I want stage four.
Them: And above 4x pipe.
Them: Stage four.
Them: And above.
Them: I like that.
Them: If people are dying.
Them: After the demo.
Them: Then that tells me that there's nothing there.
Them: In the near term.
Them: And this is probably another data grab that Will and I, we've already done the analysis on that we should share with you.
Them: A lot.
Them: What we've seen. Some of this might be categorized as subjective or qualitative data, but still valuable.
Them: We see a lot of poor behavior.
Them: On demos and poor behavior coming out of demos. As in, like Caleb has told you, they're interested in this product.
Them: And then we do the overview of our company.
Them: Or talking about something that's so not related to the Persona that we're talking to. Our reps are off camera.
Them: Not engaged in the meeting.
Them: They're not scheduling follow ups or asking the right questions.
Them: During the demo.
Me: Or they're asking questions that have already been answered and were provided in the notes.
Me: That happens all the time.
Them: As if they didn't do their prep prior to the meeting. So there's all of those more qualitative data points that we've already put together that I think will help inform some of this.
Them: Very good.
Them: Nick, please take an action item to take my nine stage sales process that I sent you and augment the stages with baseline expectations.
Them: You just mentioned three of them.
Them: No demo without being off camera. Demo needs to be centered around the product interest for inbound unless the prospect is interested in the entire portfolio.
Them: Everybody has to be on camera.
Them: No demos without a discovery having been conducted.
Them: If you could augment our non stage sales process with those anecdotes and feel free to supplement with other qualitative stuff that you've observed that we know is dumb and bad behavior.
Them: And is going to lead to deals not progressing.
Them: Have at it.
Them: Sort of like by stage success and exit criteria.
Them: Lotion criteria.
Them: Right.
Them: Bifurcate it.
Them: Expectations.
Them: Or success.
Them: And then promotion criteria.
Them: You could bifurcate it.
Them: Stick it under whichever category you think is most appropriate. I can't fucking believe that you would do a demo.
Them: And not be on camera.
Them: Absolutely.
Them: Absurd.
Them: I cannot believe the demos are happening.
Them: Without discovery happening.
Them: Absurd.
Them: Lots of stuff to change, man. I'm going to be breaking fucking glass.
Me: Love it.
Them: Break glass.
Me: Just smiles from ear to ear every time I talk to you.
Me: Keno smiles from ear to ear Just shit that we've been screaming into the void.
Me: It's like the wind has just been blowing.
Me: We've been yelling at it.
Me: Anyways.
Them: Do you want to with the short time? I know Keno has already seen this.
Them: We can jump into. I can go a little bit longer unless you guys have hard stops.
Them: I do have a hard stop. I got to close the books with finance for July.
Them: Okay?
Them: All right.
Me: I'm happy to keep going.
Me: If it's helpful.
Me: Keno.
Them: I just wanted to give you time at least, Will, to show your marketing dashboard.
Them: Because that's sort of the top of funnel.
Them: Data that was relevant to Keynote's example.
Them: He sent.
Me: Yeah.
Me: So typically, we look at.
Me: Quarter to date.
Me: And we kind of go mqlsal SQL to ops.
Them: You're familiar with all those, right?
Them: Like Sal. I am familiar with what those terms mean. I am not familiar that what I think it means is commensurate with the way that you guys have defined it.
Me: Sure.
Them: That's why I pause there quickly.
Them: But go ahead, will.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Probably the only one that is going to matter for this discussion right now.
Me: Because there's a couple of these that we likely are going to have to readapt now that you're joining Kino. And Nick and I talked about this yesterday.
Me: But mql our definition just loosely is we know who the person is.
Me: We know where they work. We have information, like contact information, and they have shown clear intent that they are looking to purchase it.
Me: A product and.
Them: Clear intent being a bottom funnel conversion of requested contact, requested demo as opposed to just viewed a comparison guide or something.
Them: You guys defining an SQL as.
Me: Well, right now an SQL is typically. Caleb has had a meeting with that person.
Me: And has gone through some level of ban and said there's a clear synergy here.
Me: We are going to hand this off to the seller's.
Them: Yeah.
Them: I want that to change.
Me: We figured. Which is why I prefaced that a second ago.
Them: Caleb's great guy.
Them: Has certainly worked with him and tried to help him get better, but I want an SQL to be accepted.
Them: Only after a proper discovery.
Them: If an account is not willing to undergo discovery, then I don't believe that is a qualified lead.
Them: You guys can call it something else.
Them: But that's what I want to see on a go forward basis.
Me: What you mean by properly a proper discovery call is not Caleb like an account executive led discovery.
Them: That's right.
Them: Caleb qualified it.
Them: I don't want that to be called a sales qualified.
Them: Lead.
Them: I want there to be demonstrable interest, and that is the customer's willingness to undergo discovery.
Them: Because they know that they won't get the demo.
Them: Until they go through the discovery. So it's a much stronger intent than what you guys are describing as a sales qualified lead.
Them: We agree.
Me: Yes.
Them: And I'll just give you the edification on how it's working right now.
Them: And understanding that this is not proper discovery prior to demo.
Them: Caleb does his calls it an SQL puts an opportunity omitted from the pipeline in a reps name.
Them: And that's when the rep is essentially coming in with an SE and doing a demo, and then they discover on that call whether or not they consider it qualified to put in their pipeline.
Me: Yeah.
Them: To your point, though, then, that discovery is occurring on that demo call rather than prior to as sort of a gateway to allow them into a demo.
Them: The way I see it working is you go through discovery.
Them: Some subset of those people are not going to progress the demo.
Them: We're going to say. You know what?
Them: This is not a good fit.
Them: We can't support that.
Them: We can't integrate to that.
Them: What you're looking for is not what we do.
Them: Whatever.
Them: And it goes away.
Them: Therefore it never becomes a sales qualified lead.
Them: I don't want to talk about it.
Them: Because it's nothing.
Them: It doesn't mean anything.
Them: It's been dismissed.
Them: You want to call what Caleb is doing?
Them: Something else.
Them: That will precede that.
Them: That's fine.
Them: So it might be marketing qualified lead, then. A Caleb qualified lead.
Them: Lead and then a sales qualified lead.
Them: I'm only interested in sales qualified and above. And I'm only interested in pipeline at Stage four.
Them: And above. So friends.
Me: We agree wholeheartedly. And I think the context that you have to trust here.
Them: We're on page.
Me: Is the reason that we have it this way, which is not the proper way.
Me: Nor is it really what Nick and I would prefer was built because we were not seeing the right behaviors.
Me: In the field.
Me: There was just constantly moving the bar up to Caleb to take on more and then progressing it backwards because reps weren't making themselves available for weeks.
Me: They weren't doing the proper discovery.
Me: At the beginning.
Me: They weren't taking the note. Like, it was all these things that Caleb was like, I'm ready to talk to people right away.
Me: Do the discovery, run the play, do the hygiene and Salesforce.
Them: Underscore.
Me: And we brought this to the last zero and said we should fix this, we should change this.
Me: This is not right.
Me: And it just never happened.
Me: So.
Them: Great opportunity.
Them: All the stuff you're talking about is PK Pre K. Everybody gets grace for PK Everybody gets grace.
Me: Exactly.
Me: A lot of this is just going to be timeline of how we change these things, but, yeah.
Me: SAO would be where Caleb would hand off to a rep and go, here's the notes.
Me: Here's the pre qualified stuff.
Me: When do you want to get on with them?
Me: And have that SQL conversation.
Them: Okay?
Them: Let's call that sdql sales development.
Them: Rep because I want to delineate between Caleb qualifying something in a rep qualifying something, and it's fine.
Them: And we call it something different and we measure all of it.
Them: But can we agree that from this point forward, SQL means that the rep has conducted discovery and we're going to index on that?
Them: For SQLs.
Them: I think we can agree that we're all on the same page.
Them: Or it's going to take a minute to implement that as a process and the system and whatnot.
Them: But that just means it won't be immediate after this call. It'll be the ones we can get it implemented.
Them: I'm a somewhat patient man. I'm a somewhat patient man. I like the cadence.
Them: I like this call.
Them: Like the progress that we made today. To be continued. I know you got a hard stop.
Them: Nick.
Them: I'll stick around for a little bit longer. Will, if you want to talk about anything else.
Me: Yeah.
Them: Yeah.
Me: I can tell you a couple more marketing related things and then.
Them: Thank you, gentlemen.
Them: This is valuable.
Them: I'll talk soon.
Me: All right.
Me: Cool.
Me: One second.
Me: I'm loving how we're running this man.
Me: This is good.
Them: Good.
Me: I'm going to share with you kind of like what type of analysis I can typically do.
Me: And I was running these pretty consistently last quarter for a bit.
Me: Knowing you were coming on, and I think we can adapt this.
Me: But all of what I've just showed you kind of can help build essentially a very simple model like weekly reporting, bi weekly reporting around. Where are we at from MQLS to target quarter to date.
Me: Where we had an sel, SQL's, opportunities, pipeline value, etc.
Me: And then I'll typically look at the $0 opportunities that sit out there.
Me: So we might have. Right now we have 25, but five of those have $0. If you take the typical ASP and run that against it.
Me: Here's where it would be.
Me: This $0 opportunity thing.
Me: I hope it's a problem that just goes away.
Me: I think Nick has already brought it to your attention.
Me: I know he's had to go in and kind of, like, basically add dollar values or move things around in the past.
Me: But I also have access to sales plays.
Me: And just looking at the types of use cases.
Me: These are out of date.
Me: And I think it's something that Nick should probably work on. I can talk to him about that, but we know our go to markets right now.
Me: Are bill Ops finops.
Me: Kubernetes. Right. Sizing with Stormforge.
Me: Cloud management in general, we might have subcategories there.
Me: These are historic terms that we should probably readapt in salesforce so we can have a better view of product use. Case, I know that's something rod's asking a lot about. I know it's something you've asked about.
Me: Right now. There's just no clear way of pulling that.
Me: And then, typically, I'll put together a trajectory.
Me: Around, okay?
Me: If we keep on this pace, where are we going to end?
Me: All of this analysis and even just in the reporting that you see here, it's all up against the numbers that we've backed into from Brendan's model of what we need, coverage wise.
Me: To hit the goals that we need to hit this year.
Them: Why is Brendan articulating coverage?
Them: Percentages and pipeline.
Me: I think it was basically the. Well, it may have been with Nick and others. These are the numbers that I know that Brendan's brought.
Me: And actually, there's a doc that you may or may not have.
Me: That's the pipeline model.
Me: Have you seen?
Me: This is marks. Hold on.
Me: I'm interested to see if this is still the same.
Me: Yeah.
Me: This is the kind of sales plan that I've worked from. This is Brendan. Brendan, sales ops. Brandon, stock.
Me: And this. And this is kind of where they've modeled out what we need to per channel, per team, et cetera, to get to the numbers we need.
Me: And so, you see, this is kind of where I've worked back from.
Them: That's like a reverse engineering.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Here's the pipeline contribution we need. And then just looking at our typical rates of progression through the pipeline,
Me: And conversion.
Me: So you see, they've been given average target win rate.
Me: Which again, is that modeled on reality, or is that modeled on expectation or what?
Me: But I'm just giving you the basis of these numbers didn't come from nowhere.
Me: Right.
Me: I'm just taking Mark, Brendan, Nick, whomever.
Me: Put together a model for the year.
Me: That's changed a few times.
Me: Now.
Me: And all of the quotas, if you will, that you see in this report, that top number are backed in from those high level numbers that were handed over.
Them: So it is Brendan's responsibility, as I understand it.
Them: To give me the number for the year.
Them: The target. It is my responsibility.
Them: To model and reverse engineer that number into the data that you're talking about. So I think it's going to change when we overlay my sales stages.
Me: Totally fine.
Them: And my criteria for x at stage 4?
Them: Or above, but I like the report that you were just showing me.
Them: But. But it's all going to change because we want forex of stage four.
Them: And above.
Them: So same format.
Them: But the number s and maybe some of the criteria will change.
Me: Cool.
Me: All right.
Them: Yeah.
Them: Can we add this to the agenda for next time?
Them: Well, I like where this is going.
Me: The other thing that I did recently, and I'm happy to do it again.
Me: Just because I think it was really insightful for everyone.
Me: Is, we typically ask hand raisers.
Me: The solutions they're interested in, like the use cases. And that's going to change with the new website taxonomy that I shared. But you lay them all out. You go Bill Ops.
Me: You go. Hey, we want allocation chargeback the things that our products do.
Me: You ask them that and then you go, okay.
Me: What company do they work for with their title?
Me: Against, like just SQLs as an example.
Me: Right.
Me: And you see.
Me: 14% of those SQLs are senior cloud leadership.
Me: Here are some of the examples.
Me: Here's a roll up, essentially.
Me: Cloud engineering leadership.
Me: Cloud ops, IT infrastructure management. So I can get you kind of a consolidated view of like here are the hand raisers by category.
Me: You're talking about VP and above. I know that's for Outbound, but I'd be interested to see the mix.
Me: Right, right now.
Me: People that are reaching out to us.
Me: Specifically, so all this stuff is available. I just think we got to get to a cadence of when you want to see it.
Me: I can give you the most recent versions of it.
Me: To your email.
Me: Just so you kind of know what I'm doing today.
Them: What would be the frequency that you would propose where there will be some statistically significant movement between the different categories that would warrant review?
Them: How often would you propose that we look at this?
Them: Before you answer, just understand I hate to have meetings for the sake of having meetings.
Them: I like to have meetings.
Them: With purpose.
Them: With an agenda.
Them: And with a call to action.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Totally get it.
Me: I think all of this is just to flood you with. Here's kind of what's happening today.
Me: I do think that biweekly cadence for you, me and Nick. The initial agenda I propose is like, let's start with 15 minutes of flashing in front of you what you want to see.
Me: Already given us some examples.
Me: You're seeing a lot of the reports here.
Me: I'm looking at marketing numbers.
Me: Every week.
Me: Usually a couple times a week.
Me: I don't need to flood you with that every week.
Me: But I do want to start by going with this many hand raisers.
Them: Okay?
Me: The ones that are keynote qualified, right?
Me: Fall into that category.
Me: Of what Keno is looking for.
Me: Is this many. Here's how they've progressed, here's where they're at.
Me: And then having Nick do some sort of high level pipeline.
Me: Breakdown of what's being driven to the field.
Me: Versus the channel, versus marketing.
Me: We could spend 10 to 15 minutes in the front end of each of these calls.
Me: Probably a good place to start.
Them: Let's do it.
Them: I have another question for you, Will, while it's on my mind.
Them: So I want to identify and I'll take your lead on who the right people are, the hand raisers, people at stage four, whatever.
Them: You could tell me what the starting point is, but I want to identify those opportunities.
Them: When the time elapsed between sales stages is in violation.
Them: Of my 30 day rule.
Them: 30 days to progress.
Them: An opportunity.
Them: And I want us to with the reps.
Them: Review. Just that. Just that.
Them: Here are the seven opportunities.
Them: In stage three that have been in Salesforce for longer than 30 days without pipeline progression reps.
Them: Where are we? This. Where is that? Close it out.
Them: Or you got two days to close it out or.
Them: Get the next step.
Them: Nailed down. Would that be more appropriate? And I don't know whose responsibility it would be.
Them: Would that be more your responsibility? More Nick's responsibility?
Them: And what do you think?
Them: Is the best way to operationalize that.
Them: By that, I mean separate meeting with just the reps.
Them: Or tag on to the forecast call and extend it by a little bit of time.
Them: So that we can collectively stay on top of pipeline progression.
Me: I honestly think you're better served tacking it onto forecasting.
Me: The forecast call now at the front end of your tenure because there's so many as you're probably seeing and hearing just non ideal behaviors happening right now.
Them: Okay?
Me: And so until you get that short up,
Me: And people really understand. No, these are unacceptable things.
Me: Like putting them out in the open and being very candid about it.
Me: It's probably right.
Me: I would also.
Me: I wouldn't stop it.
Me: At a 30 day progression.
Me: I would also look at inactivity.
Me: Right.
Them: That's what I'm saying.
Me: But, I mean, how often do you expect. What's the constant contact flow that you would expect for an open stage, an open deal once a week?
Them: 30 days.
Me: Minimum.
Them: Y'all don't have any really strong feelings about that?
Them: Because the progression of the deal will inform whether or not the appropriate amount of contact was given. If the opportunity is stuck, it's not moving.
Them: That could not necessarily be symptomatic of the frequency of contact. It could just be a lack of interest. Or the timing is wrong.
Them: Whatever. But that's what to me informs is much more informative.
Them: Not let them figure out why it's stuck.
Them: And either get it unstuck or close it out.
Them: So the penalty is there.
Them: Carrot and stick are both there.
Them: Why would we want to talk about remember? Or already asking the reps for a buck ton of stuff that they haven't had to do previously? And I'm a little sensitive to continuing to add extra work for the sake of work.
Me: Yeah.
Them: I want.
Me: I get your point.
Me: So what you're saying is by focusing on the progression of the deal, period.
Me: All these other things just naturally solve themselves.
Them: They will.
Them: Yeah.
Me: Yeah.
Them: You got three choices.
Them: When an opportunity is stuck for more than 30 days in any stage.
Them: If it's stuck for 30 days.
Them: You got to close it out.
Them: You got to progress it.
Them: Or you got to explain to me.
Them: Why it should remain open for another week.
Them: Guys.
Them: On vacation. He promised he's going to respond by this date.
Them: Something like that.
Them: But you're forced to do something. If we identify the opportunities.
Them: That are stuck.
Them: For 30 days in any particular stage.
Me: I agree.
Me: I think that's right.
Me: And I do think you should tack it onto the weekly forecast.
Them: Forecast.
Them: Scott.
Them: Because if we limit it to just opportunities,
Them: That are stuck for 30 days.
Them: How many you suspect we'd be talking about during the forecast call.
Me: Right now.
Me: It's going to be a lot.
Me: Once we do a clip, this is going to be my next point. Is it? Behoove you to.
Me: Go through a cleanup exercise.
Me: Of just steel deals.
Me: And what I mean by that. And I could send you this.
Me: Probably do this in less analog manner, but let's just.
Me: Look at how many were created like last year.
Me: I mean, we got. We got deals.
Me: From 2023.
Me: Sitting here.
Me: We got deals.
Me: From q1.
Me: 2024.
Me: 20, you know, Q2, 20, 24.
Me: Oh, this stuff.
Them: Hadn't been closed out.
Me: 41 these are all.
Me: This is just marketing, too. I mean, there's other. There's other stuff, but, I mean, you know, age. Look at the age.
Me: Here.
Me: I mean, let's look at inactive dates.
Me: Some of these are 200 plus, 100 plus, 90 plus. Like I say, inactive days. You'll have to ask Nick, but I believe this is activity based.
Me: Not necessarily progression.
Me: But just no email, no meeting, no nothing.
Me: Maybe that's not our new anchor metric.
Me: Maybe it's just progression.
Me: It sounds like that's what you want to do, and I think that cleans all of this stuff up.
Me: But you probably should start thinking about coming up with an informed opinion about how to handle this kind of stuff.
Me: Because it's part of the reason I wanted to change the agenda today.
Me: Is. I'll send this to you, but you may want to have thoughts, but Nick and others about how we just go mass clean this up.
Me: I don't know how that changes what we're reporting to the board.
Me: Or da da da da da da da. But there's no way most of this is real.
Me: Anymore.
Them: I'm not concerned about any of this at all.
Them: Will. For the simple reason is I have no fucking idea.
Them: Why it is.
Them: What it is.
Them: And I don't really care on what was done before me.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Good.
Them: The stuff that I'm talking about is strictly for all net new opportunities.
Them: On a go forward basis.
Them: I don't have any interest in cleaning up the old data.
Them: From my vantage point.
Them: All that shit is dead.
Them: They should all be closed out.
Them: If it's not in the pipeline.
Them: It's actively being worked.
Them: It's pk it's dead. Everybody gets grace. Sorry.
Them: It was a clusterfuck. Nothing that we can do about it.
Me: Sure.
Them: And if somebody comes across a new opportunity.
Them: That allows one of the old opportunities to be resurrected.
Them: Then we can just put it in salesforces.
Them: So I don't want to spend too much time digesting, contemplating, course correcting the stuff that happened in the past.
Them: Because it may just not be salvageable, and I don't think it's a good use of time.
Me: Yeah.
Me: Maybe I should be clear. The reason I'm asking is if we run that on the forecast call this first time you do it.
Me: You're going to be going through line items.
Me: From two years ago.
Me: So maybe the first one, there's not enough room on a forecast call. Maybe it's an email first to say we're going to be doing this on the next forecast call. You need to go look at your Here are all your deals.
Me: That are sitting out here from 600 days ago.
Me: Clean them up if they're not real.
Me: Or I don't know what the criteria would be.
Them: Good suggestion. I'm going to do it as soon as we get off this call.
Me: Yeah.
Me: So I just wanted to make sure. Like Earl said, be a six hour call.
Them: Got a warm down.
Me: What else?
Me: Man. Is there any. I'm an open book. Is there any questions? You have anything in your mind where you want my opinion, objective opinion, or are you feeling. Was this helpful?
Me: Was today helpful?
Them: This was very helpful.
Them: Today. Step in the right direction.
Them: It won't be.
Them: It wasn't nearly as helpful.
Them: As it will be.
Them: Once we've established the go forward cadence.
Them: And you guys can get me answers to the questions.
Them: That I have.
Them: But it was very helpful.
Them: And my takeaways from this.
Them: Are to get on the forecast call to get on the forecast cadence.
Them: On a go forward basis.
Them: And I like your suggestion. Just adding it to the forecast call and then secondarily to dig in immediately to this motion.
Them: Around Storm Forge and Kubernetes make that decision and then decide what to do.
Them: About Josh once we iron out? Because I have a feeling the opportunities are going to plummet, and that's not a bad thing.
Them: We want all the gmails. Shit.
Them: To go away or to be able to touch them.
Them: And keep them informed.
Them: Until they're ready to get to divulge who they are.
Them: The company when it becomes more meaningful.
Them: So very long answer to your question.
Them: Yes.
Them: It was very helpful.
Me: Awesome.
Me: I will spend the next couple weeks thinking about how I can get the reports on Stage four and above, as well as some reporting or analysis on VP or above. And I'll also bring back to the marketing team.
Me: Our new order of battle here is, like, we want to get meetings with VPs or higher.
Them: Yes.
Them: And I'm happy to trade that for a lot less meetings.
Them: I'm happy to trade that.
Me: Yeah, okay.
Me: Awesome, Kino. Thank you so much.
Me: Man. I appreciate you having a very formed and direct opinion.
Me: That makes my job easier.
Me: So I'm here.
Me: To make you successful.
Me: Man.
Them: We have a very good working relationship. And I trust it'll only get better. I like the way that you think, and I love your energy.
Me: Let's.
Them: And having very strong, good favorable impressions of you.
Me: Two ways, man.
Me: I feel the same way about you.
Me: Let's get it done.
Me: We partner in crime later.
Me: Man.
Them: Talk to. See ya.
