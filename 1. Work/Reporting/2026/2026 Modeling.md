# Executive reframing (TL;DR)

**Core issue:** The 2026 model is mixing clean funnel math with broad, uniform assumptions and a fuzzy ownership split. That combination inflates top-of-funnel requirements (esp. for Marketing), obscures what Sales/CS must actually do, and risks building a plan you can’t staff or govern.

**Working hypothesis:** If we (a) calibrate conversion by motion and product, (b) model “push vs. loss” explicitly, and (c) re-cut sourcing as _Inbound / Outbound / Expansion (CS-led) / Partner_ instead of “Marketing vs. Sales,” the **Stage 1 requirement falls 20–35% and the split between teams rebalances materially**, with clearer operating targets per quarter.

# What the current math is _really_ saying

- **Starting “bank” needed 1/1/26 (Stage 4+):** **$7.4M**. You’re ~**$3.2–4.0M** today → **gap ≈ $3.4–$4.2M** in ~10 weeks (your back-of-napkin **~$600k/week** is consistent).
    
- **In-year creation targets:**
    - **Stage 4+ new creation (’26):** **$43.5M** (to offset “retired” pipeline and still finish at ~$16.3M).
    - **Stage 1–3 creation (’26):** **$89.9M** (weekly avg **$1.73M**).
        
- **Implied conversion stack (uniform):** **50%** (Stage 1→4) × **25%** (Stage 4→Won) = **12.5%** Stage1→Won.
    
    - Uniformity here is the biggest hidden risk. Upsell≠Cross-sell≠New Logo; Inbound≠Outbound; CMP≠FinOps≠K8s. Treating them the same overstates some pools (e.g., marketing new logo) and understates others (e.g., upsell in healthy accounts).
        
- **Ownership split baked into the model:** **Marketing $47.2M (53%)** | **Sales New Logo $15.7M (17%)** | **Sales Cross/Up $27.0M (30%)**.
    
    - This _does not_ square with your Asana initiative mix or this year’s reality (~$12M mktg top-funnel YTD; field/partner producing meaningful Stage 4 today).

# Assumptions to surface (and stress-test)

Use these as the “assumption bible” you wanted—MECE and testable.

## A) Funnel mechanics

1. **Stage 4→Won rate (by motion):**
    
    - New Logo Inbound, New Logo Outbound, Cross-sell, Upsell **(four distinct rates)**.
        
    - **Hypothesis:** Upsell > Cross-sell ≥ Outbound > Inbound at Stage 4.
        
2. **Stage 1→4 pass rate (by source):** Inbound vs Outbound vs Partner-referred vs Exec-referred.
    
    - **Hypothesis:** Curated Outbound/Exec-referral > Partner-referred > Inbound.
        
3. **Push vs. Loss handling at Stage 4:** Not every non-win “retires.”
    
    - **Introduce a push rate** (e.g., win:loss:push = 1:2:1). This **reduces “retire” burden** and lowers required new Stage 4.
        
4. **Cycle length by product/motion:** To set **lead time** and ensure the Q1/Q2 targets are even time-feasible.
    

## B) Mix & economics

5. **Product ASPs:** CMP $145k, FinOps $50k, BillOps $200k, K8s $200k (sanity-check with last 12–24 months).
    
    - **Hypothesis:** BillOps/K8s ASPs are lumpy; plan with median and a whale overlay.
        
6. **ARR mix targets by product vs. roadmap reality:** If CMP is the revenue backbone, the **roadmap, enablement, and content** must reflect that.
    
7. **Expansion mix realism:** Split **upsell vs. cross-sell** by product (e.g., CMP upsell viable; FinOps cross-sell harder given platform maturity).
    

## C) Ownership & sourcing

8. **Source taxonomy:** Move from **Marketing vs Sales** to **Inbound / Outbound / Expansion (CS-led) / Partner**.
    
    - Then **map** each Asana initiative to this taxonomy.
        
9. **Partner motion definition:** Referral vs Co-sell vs Resell—each has different funnel yields.
    
10. **Attribution policy for joint motions:** ABM, events, and partner-assisted plays should not default to “Marketing sourced.”
    

## D) Operating model

11. **Stage definitions & hygiene enforcement:** Especially Stage 4 entry criteria (demo, ROI hypothesis, EB access, mutual plan).
    
12. **Cadence:** Weekly Stage-4 creation goal by segment/product; monthly assumption review with red/green callouts.
    
13. **Capacity:** SDR/AE/CSM time required to physically execute the outbound, expansions, and partner motions embedded in the plan.

# Red flags / concerns

- **Over-weight on Marketing new logo ($47M) vs. historic ~$12M YTD.** Absent a step-change in strategy/budget/capacity, this is not credible.
- **Uniform conversions (50% / 25%)** mask reality; they likely **overstate** cross-sell difficulty and **understate** upsell potential where adoption is strong.
- **No “push” modeling** inflates the “retired” pipeline and **overstates** new creation needs by a meaningful margin (you estimated ~$17M delta moving from 4× to 3×).
- **Product/roadmap misalignment:** CMP is expected to carry the number, but **investment and new value proof** need to match.
- **Partner bucket ambiguity:** 10M Stage 1 from partners with generic 50%/25% is **not** evidence-based.
- **Sales-sourced new logo motion is thin.** If outbound remains underpowered, the whole model leans on inbound/partner—historically inconsistent.
- **Capacity math missing:** Weekly creation targets imply a **very high AE/SDR activity load**. Without activity→meeting→SQL benchmarks, it’s hand-wavy.
- **Governance risk:** If Asana initiatives and finance plan aren’t fused, teams will chase different targets.

# What I’d change first (80/20)

1. **Re-cut sourcing now:** **Inbound | Outbound | Expansion | Partner** (and only then map to team accountability). Re-allocate the $47.2M/$15.7M/$27.0M to these four.
    
2. **Introduce “push” explicitly** at Stage 4 (e.g., 20–30%). Recompute “retired” and **reduce the Stage 4 creation requirement**.
    
3. **Segment conversion assumptions** (min/target) by **motion × product**—four motions × up to four products = at most 12 cells. Keep it simple; set **guardrails** (e.g., Upsell S4→Win 35–45%, Inbound New Logo 18–25%, etc.).
    
4. **Run three scenarios** (Conservative / Base / Stretch) and **cap Marketing new logo** at a credible ceiling tied to budgeted channels + field ABM support.
    
5. **Tie model to the Asana plan**: every line item tagged to the four-bucket taxonomy, with **Stage 4 output** (not just Stage 1) and an **owner**.
    
6. **Set product-level goals** that match roadmap and enablement lift; if CMP carries >50% ARR, reflect that in **content, SE assets, and release themes**.
    
7. **Publish a one-page “Assumption Bible”** with 12 bullets above; review monthly; color-code variances and adjust the plan in-quarter.

# Questions to take into XCOM (Socratic prompts)

**Funnel & targets**

- What is our **minimum acceptable** S4→Win for **Upsell** and **Cross-sell** in healthy accounts? (If ≥35–40%, Stage 4 requirement drops materially.)
    
- What **push rate** do we accept at Stage 4? Where do pushed opps land (next Q only or rolling 4-month)?
    

**Mix & roadmap**

- If we expect **CMP to drive the year**, what **3–5 “new value” anchors** (features, integrations, benchmarks) will Sales market against Broadcom/Morpheus?
    
- For **K8s**: are we planning a **whale strategy** (few big deals) or **velocity** (many $200k deals)? The target of **$8.5M marketing-sourced K8s pipeline** needs one of those stories.
    

**Ownership**

- Can we agree to **four-source taxonomy** and then assign **accountability** (Mktg supports many plays but doesn’t “own” their sourcing)?
    
- Which **partner motions** are real in 1H’26 (named partners, motions, targets)? If “referral,” treat as **Inbound** for conversion purposes.
    

**Capacity & budget**

- What **activity model** (per AE/SDR/CSM) underpins the weekly Stage 4 target? Do we have the **headcount/time**?
    
- What **net-new budget** and **channel mix** would it take for Marketing to credibly move from ~$12M to even **$25–30M** Stage-1 creation?

# How to operate this plan (Balanced Scorecard lens)

**Financial:** Quarterly bookings; CAC payback by motion; pipeline coverage at both **Stage 1 and Stage 4**.  
**Customer:** Win rates by motion/product; expansion penetration in named accounts; NPS→expansion correlation.  
**Internal process:** Stage hygiene SLA; **time-to-Stage-4**; partner SLA on co-sell steps.  
**Learning/growth:** AE play adoption; SE demo asset coverage; CS expansion plays per ICP.

# Concrete next steps (two weeks)

1. **Model refactor (Brendan + you + Sales Ops):**
    
    - Add **push rate** and flip “retired” from 4× to 3× (test both).
        
    - Split conversions into **12 cells** (motion × product) with **Base/High/Low**.
        
2. **Asana alignment (you + Nick):**
    
    - Tag every initiative **Inbound/Outbound/Expansion/Partner** and estimate **Stage 4 output** + quarter.
        
    - Produce a **waterfall** of Stage 4 creation by quarter vs. target.
        
3. **Sales/CS calibration (Sean + Frank):**
    
    - Name **Top 50 expansion candidates** with expected $ and quarter; set **upsell S4→Win target ≥35–45%** where product fit is strong.
        
4. **Partner reality check (Colton + Dave):**
    
    - Choose **2–3 partners** for co-sell pilot; define **joint-sourced Stage 4** targets and hygiene rules.
        
5. **CMP enablement plan (PM + PMM):**
    
    - Lock **3–5 competitive narrative upgrades** and the **asset calendar** that supports CMP being >50% of ARR.

# What “good” will look like by end of Q1’26

- Stage 4 bank ≥ **$10.5M** (model target), with **≥40%** of S4 from **Expansion & curated Outbound** (healthier mix).
    
- A **live dashboard** showing **weekly Stage 4 creation vs. plan** by the four sources and by product.
    
- A living **Assumption Bible**—variances drive decisions (budget shift, program kill, headcount redeploy) in-quarter, not post-mortem.
    

If you want, I’ll draft the one-pager “Assumption Bible” and a simple 3-scenario sensitivity grid next.
