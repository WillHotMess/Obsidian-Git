Approximately 70% of global IT and cloud spending is transacted via channel partners—distributors, resellers, and MSPs—while only 30% is procured directly from hyperscalers.

AWS and Azure together account for over half of the global cloud infrastructure market. The most recent and widely cited estimates for 2025 are:
- AWS: 30–32% global share
- Azure: 20–25% global share (varies by source and region)

**Subject: Finalized Cloud Market Analysis: Methodology for Our Indirect Channel TAM & SAM**

Hi Team,

Following up on our analysis of the public cloud market, I wanted to provide a clear summary of the methodology we used to arrive at our final figures for the Total Addressable Market (TAM) and Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM).

This data-driven approach gives us a solid, defensible foundation for our strategic planning. Here is the step-by-step funnel we used to calculate the opportunity:

**1. Started with Total Global Public Cloud Spend:**  
We began with the overall market size, using top-tier analyst data. The key figure here is the projected global spend on public cloud services for 2025.

- **Source:** [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-11-19-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-end-user-spending-to-total-723-billion-dollars-in-2025)
    
- **Figure:** **$723.4 billion** in total public cloud spending for 2025.
    

**2. Focused on the Relevant Segments (IaaS & PaaS):**  
To refine our focus, we isolated the spending on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS), which are the core of our business.

- **Source:** Gartner
    
- **Figure:** **$420.5 billion** combined IaaS/PaaS spend in 2025.
    

**3. Applied the Indirect Channel Assumption (Global TAM):**  
Based on multiple strong data points, we applied the foundational assumption that ~70% of cloud spend is procured through indirect channels (distributors, resellers, MSPs). This gives us our Total Addressable Market.

- **Sources:** Ofcom's comprehensive UK market study, Microsoft CSP program data (showing ~90% of partners are indirect), and general channel research.
    
- **Calculation:** $420.5B (Total IaaS/PaaS) x 70% = **$294.4 billion** Global Indirect TAM.
    

**4. Segmented by Key Regions:**  
We then broke down the Global Indirect TAM into our key operational regions: North America (NA), EMEA, and Latin America (LATAM). This allowed us to see where the market value is concentrated.
- https://www.statista.com/chart/18819/worldwide-market-share-of-leading-cloud-infrastructure-service-providers/
- https://electroiq.com/stats/microsoft-azure-statistics/
- https://hginsights.com/blog/aws-market-report-buyer-landscape

**5. Calculated the Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):**  
To understand the portion of the market we can realistically service, we overlaid the regional market shares for our primary targets, **AWS** and **Azure**. This is our SAM.

## Summary: The Final Indirect SAM Figures (2025)

This methodology resulted in the following Serviceable Addressable Market for the indirect channel in our key regions:

- **North America (NA):**
    
    - AWS SAM: **$45.8 billion**
        
    - Azure SAM: **$35.4 billion**
        
- **EMEA:**
    
    - AWS SAM: **$22.8 billion**
        
    - Azure SAM: **$27.1 billion**
        
- **Latin America (LATAM):**
    
    - AWS SAM: **$6.9 billion**
        
    - Azure SAM: **$4.6 billion**
        

This provides us with a combined partner-addressable market for AWS and Azure of **$142.6 billion** across these three regions alone.

This structured approach ensures our targets and strategies are grounded in solid market data. Please let me know if you have any questions as you digest these numbers.

Best,

William Norton



**LATAM 2025 Cloud Computing Market Size:** $55.18 billion
**EMEA** **2024 Public Cloud Spending in Europe:** $123 billion
AWS holds a **30-32%** market share
Microsoft Azure has a **20-23%** share
North America accounts for **41%** of the global cloud market


**Subject: Our Cloud Market Analysis: A Breakdown of the Methodology**

Hi Team,

**Preamble: The Challenge of Sizing the Cloud BillOps Market**

The primary difficulty in creating a TAM for a Cloud FinOps and BillOps platform is that our pricing model is correlated to our clients' cloud spend under management, which is not publicly available. Unlike traditional business metrics, this figure cannot be reliably derived from publicly available information like a company's headcount or total revenue.

A classic example is a company like Instagram in its early days: it had very few employees but an immense cloud spend, while technically being "underwater" on revenue. Because of this, standard market sizing models fall short. While there are costly tools that can estimate public cloud spend using network analysis, what is below relies on a top-down model with several heavy assumptions.

Therefore, this analysis should be treated as directionally accurate, not specifically accurate. It provides an idea of the market's scale, not a precise accounting figure.

Here is the step-by-step logic I followed to arrive at these numbers for 2025:

**1. Started with the Total Global Public Cloud Market**  
- **Market Size:** **$723.4 Billion**
- **Source:** Gartner’s 2025 Forecast

**2. Narrowed to Our Core Disti Business: IaaS & PaaS**  
- **Market Size:** **$420 Billion**
- **Source:** Gartner’s 2025 Forecast

**3. Isolated the Key Providers: Azure & AWS** **(Our Serviceable Market)** 
Next, we calculated the portion of the IaaS/PaaS market held by our primary cloud providers, AWS (30-32% share) and Azure (20-23% share).
- **Market Size:** **~$210 Billion – $230 Billion**

**4. Applied the Indirect Procurement Assumption** **(Our Serviceable Market)** 
This is a critical step. We applied the foundational assumption that **70%** of cloud business is procured through indirect channels like ours. This gives us the total addressable market (TAM) for the channel within the AWS and Azure ecosystems.
- **Market Size:** **~$147 Billion – $161 Billion**
- **Source for Assumption:** Based on research from Ofcom, Channel Partners, analysis of Microsoft's CSP program, and general market data. 

**5. Segmented by Key Regions (Our Service Obtainable Market)**  
Finally, we broke down that global indirect market into our three key regions—North America, EMEA, and LATAM—to determine our specific serviceable market.
- **Market Size:** **~$101 Billion – $112 Billion**
	- **North America:** Assumed to represent **41% of the global market**, based on data from Precedence Research.
	- **EMEA:** Used Gartner's 2024 figure of $123B for Europe and applied the global market's year-over-year growth rate (~21.4%) to project it forward.
	- Assumed that the combined market share of AWS and Azure (ranging from **50% to 55%**) within the IaaS/PaaS segment is uniform across North America, EMEA, and LATAM.
	- Finally, we assumed that the foundational **70% indirect procurement model** applies equally to each of these three regions.


**Addendum: Key Assumptions & Limitations

**1. Cross-Regional Spend Management**  
Our model calculates the market within specific regional boundaries (NA, EMEA, LATAM). It does not account for how much spend from _other_ regions (like APAC) is managed by parent companies or billing operations that sit within our target regions. It's possible our Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) is **higher** than calculated, as we can service distributors and resellers whose billing operations are in the US or Europe, even if the end-customer is elsewhere.

**2. The 70% Indirect Procurement Assumption**  
This is the most significant assumption in our model. The 70% figure is based on data for _total IT procurement_, not specifically _cloud spend procurement_[7](https://www.procurify.com/blog/direct-vs-indirect-procurement/). It is possible that more companies procure cloud services directly from hyperscalers than the model assumes. Currently, there is no public information from AWS or Azure confirming their direct vs. indirect split. To refine this, we may need to commission custom research from a firm like Gartner or IDC.

3. **Distributor-Dominated Market**
A significant—but unquantified—portion of the indirect market runs through major distributors like TD SYNNEX and managed cloud companies like Rackspace. These channels can be harder to penetrate directly. Our model identifies the total indirect market but does not segment out the portion that is potentially locked within these large, established distributor ecosystems, which could affect our ability to capture the full addressable market.
Let's discuss these points further in our next meeting.


Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

William Norton


Of course. Here is a draft email that incorporates the addendum and the important precursor about the nature of a Cloud FinOps TAM.

**Subject: Addendum to Our Cloud Market Analysis: Important Context and Assumptions**

Hi Team,

Building on our market analysis, I want to add some critical context and highlight the key assumptions we made. This is essential for ensuring we interpret and use these numbers correctly.

First, it's important to frame why this analysis requires a unique approach.

**Preamble: The Challenge of Sizing the Cloud BillOps Market**

Therefore, this analysis should be treated as directionally accurate, not specifically accurate. It provides an idea of the market's scale, not a precise accounting figure.

**Addendum: Key Assumptions & Limitations in Our Model**

Here are three significant factors that are not fully accounted for in our current model:

**1. Cross-Regional Spend Management**  
Our model calculates the market within specific regional boundaries (NA, EMEA, LATAM). It does not account for how much spend from _other_ regions (like APAC) is managed by parent companies or billing operations that sit within our target regions.
