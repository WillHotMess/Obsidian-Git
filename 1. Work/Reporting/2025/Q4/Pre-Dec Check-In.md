## 1. What the CSV says about 2025 YTD marketing pipeline

From the file you shared (140 marketing-sourced opps, all 2025-created):

### Marketing contribution vs 2025 plan

Using your stated targets and numbers:

- **2025 starting targets**
    
    - Overall pipeline target: **$11,851,852**
        
    - Marketing pipeline target: **$9,000,000** (~$2.25M/quarter)
        
    - Marketing planned as **60%** of total pipeline
        
    - ASP: **$110k**
        
    - Planned close rate: **13.5%**
        
- **2025 YTD marketing-sourced pipeline**
    
    - **Including StormForge:** **$14,742,456.76**
        
        - = **163.8%** of the $9M marketing target
            
        - = **124.4%** of the _entire company_ pipeline target of $11.85M
            
    - **Excluding StormForge (per your number):** **$12,697,916.76**
        
        - = **141.1%** of the $9M target
            
    - You generated **96% of last year’s total pipeline**
        
        - 2024: ~$15,344,168
            
        - 2025 YTD (incl. StormForge): ~$14.74M
            
        - And you did that with _less_ budget and fewer resources.
            

### Quarterly view vs 2.25M/quarter target (from the CSV)

Sum of ARR by `Created Fiscal`:

|Quarter|Pipeline ($)|% of 2.25M target|
|---|---|---|
|2025-Q1|$4.17M|~185%|
|2025-Q2|$4.78M|~213%|
|2025-Q3|$3.03M|~135%|
|2025-Q4*|$2.76M|~123%|

*Q4 is partial (through 11/20).

So: **marketing has materially outperformed its original pipeline mandate every quarter** and has essentially rebuilt last year’s volume with less fuel.

## 2. Outcomes and conversion so far

From the CSV:

- **Total marketing-sourced pipeline (ARR):** $14.74M
    
- **Status breakdown (by dollars):**
    
    - **Open:** $6.15M (≈ **41.7%**)
        
    - **Closed Lost:** $7.19M (≈ **48.8%**)
        
    - **Closed Won:** $1.40M (≈ **9.5%**)
        

### Win rates vs assumptions

- **Realized win rate (by ARR) so far:**
    
    - $1.40M closed won ÷ $14.74M pipeline ≈ **9.5%**
        
- **Assumed win rate from CRO model:**
    
    - 20% reach Stage 4, then 50% win → **10%** of Stage 1 dollars become Closed Won
        

So your _overall_ win rate (9.5%) is actually **quite close** to the 10% implicit in the new model. The main disconnect is **how you get there** (especially Stage 1 → Stage 4 and the weekly volume assumptions), not the final win rate itself.

---

## 3. Actual progression vs the CRO’s funnel assumptions

Using `Highest Stage Reached` and grouping into tiers:

- **Tier 1 – Discovery**  
    (`Discovery`, `2. Discovery/Pain Quantification`)
    
- **Tier 2 – Prove/POC**  
    (`3. Demo`, `Prove`, `5. POC/Validation Event`)
    
- **Tier 3 – ROI/Proposal/Negotiation (Stage 4+ equivalent)**  
    (`4. Preliminary ROI w EB`, `6. Convert ROI`, `7. Final EB Meeting`, `8. Final Proposal`, `Proposal`, `Negotiate`)
    

Across **all** 2025 marketing deals:

- **Stage 1 → Stage 4+ progression (by ARR)**
    
    - Tier 3 (Stage 4+) dollars: **$3.46M**
        
    - Total pipeline dollars: **$14.74M**
        
    - ⇒ **≈ 23% of Stage 1 dollars reach Stage 4+**
        
    - vs CRO assumption of **20%** – your real data is actually **slightly better** than 20%.
        
- **Stage 4+ → Closed Won (by ARR)**
    
    - Stage 4+ pool: **$3.46M**
        
    - Closed Won from that pool: **$1.36M**
        
    - ⇒ **≈ 39–40% Stage 4+ → Won**, not 50%.
        

So:

- Your **Stage 1 → Stage 4** conversion is **stronger than assumed**.
    
- Your **Stage 4 → Won** conversion is **meaningfully weaker than the 50% assumption** (about **40%** now, with some open Stage 4+ opps that could still close).
    

---

## 4. Are $875k and $600k/week logically consistent?

Given the CRO’s progression assumptions:

- **20% of Stage 1 → Stage 4**
    
- **50% of Stage 4 → Closed Won**
    

That implies:

- Stage 4 dollars = **20%** of Stage 1 dollars
    
- Closed Won dollars = **10%** of Stage 1 dollars
    

Now apply that to the new weekly goals:

- **Stated targets:**
    
    - **$875k** in new pipeline each week (Stage 1)
        
    - **$600k** in new Stage 4 pipeline each week
        

### Internal math check

If only **20% of Stage 1 dollars** progress to Stage 4:

- To produce **$600k/week** in new Stage 4, you’d need:
    
    > Stage 1 needed = $600k ÷ 0.20 = **$3.0M/week**
    

But the plan says Stage 1 pipeline is only **$875k/week**.

- Under the given assumptions, **$875k/week of Stage 1 can only produce**:
    
    > Stage 4 pipeline = 20% × $875k = **$175k/week**
    

So for the stated goals to be true simultaneously:

- The implied Stage 1 → Stage 4 progression would have to be:
    
    > $600k ÷ $875k ≈ **69%**
    

…which is **~3× higher** than both:

- The **20%** theoretical assumption, and
    
- Your actual **~23%** from the 2025 data.
    

### Implied bookings from the new targets

If you _did_ hit **$600k/week in Stage 4** and actually converted **50%** of that:

- **Closed Won per week** = 50% × $600k = **$300k/week**
    
- Over 52 weeks → **~$15.6M in new ARR per year** from this pipeline model alone.
    

By contrast, from this year’s marketing cohort so far:

- Closed Won ARR: **~$1.4M**
    
- Run-rate Closed Won per week ≈ **$30k/week** (with time left for open deals to close, but still nowhere near $300k/week).
    

**Conclusion:**  
The combination of **$875k/week Stage 1**, **$600k/week Stage 4**, and **20%/50% progression** is **not mathematically coherent** and is **an order of magnitude above current realized performance**.

---

## 5. Capacity vs new weekly targets (run-rate view)

From the CSV (using calendar weeks between 1/6 and 11/20):

- **Average marketing-sourced new pipeline (Stage 1) per week**
    
    - ≈ **$323k/week** → annualized ≈ **$16.8M**
        
- **Average marketing-sourced Stage 4+ dollars per week**
    
    - ≈ **$76k/week** → annualized ≈ **$3.9M**
        

Compare that to the CRO’s **company-wide** goals:

- **Target Stage 1/week:** $875k → **$45.5M/year**
    
- **Target Stage 4/week:** $600k → **$31.2M/year**
    

So marketing is currently at roughly:

- **Stage 1:** $323k vs $875k target → **~37% of the required weekly volume**
    
- **Stage 4+:** $76k vs $600k target → **~13% of the required weekly volume**
    

If marketing is supposed to remain ~**60%** of the funnel:

- Marketing’s share of Stage 1 target: **$525k/week**
    
    - Requires **~1.6×** more weekly Stage 1 pipeline than your 2025 run-rate.
        
- Marketing’s share of Stage 4 target: **$360k/week**
    
    - Requires **~4.7×** more weekly Stage 4+ pipeline than the 2025 run-rate.
        

And that’s **with no additional budget**, even though:

- You’ve already hit **141–164%** of the original marketing target, and
    
- Nearly matched last year’s pipeline with less spend.
    

This is the core “physics of the funnel” argument you want to make.

## 6. Closed Lost: farthest stage reached vs the progression assumptions

Looking only at **Closed Lost** marketing opps:

- Closed Lost pipeline (ARR): **$7.19M**
    

Using `Highest Stage Reached` → Stage tiers:

|Farthest Stage Reached*|ARR Lost|% of Closed Lost|
|---|---|---|
|Tier 1 – Discovery|$1.82M|~25%|
|Tier 2 – Prove / POC|$0.88M|~12%|
|Tier 3 – ROI / Proposal+|$0.82M|~11%|
|Unknown / not tracked|$3.68M|~51%|

*Tiers are mapped from your `Highest Stage Reached` values.

Key takeaways:

- Only about **11% of lost dollars** are documented as having made it to a **Stage 4+ equivalent** (ROI/proposal/negotiation) before being lost.
    
- Roughly **half of lost pipeline** has **no recorded “highest stage”** at all.  
    That’s a **major data quality gap** that makes it risky to hard-wire precise 20% / 50% funnel expectations.
    
- In practice, your progression is much **“lumpier”** than the neat model: a lot of dollars die in Discovery / early stages, and many records aren’t staged cleanly enough to be modeled.
    

This strongly supports your argument that:

1. The **funnel math needs to be grounded in actual CRM data**, and
    
2. **Stage hygiene** must improve before using tight stage-to-stage conversion KPIs.

**Subject:** 2025 YTD Marketing Pipeline vs Targets & Implications for 2026 Funnel Plan

Hi <Name>,

As we lock in the 2026 funnel model, I wanted to share a data-driven view of what Marketing has delivered in 2025 and how that compares to the new weekly pipeline and progression assumptions.

### 1. Marketing’s contribution vs the 2025 plan

Going into 2025 we set:

- Overall pipeline target: **$11.85M**
    
- Marketing pipeline target: **$9.0M** (≈ $2.25M per quarter, 60% of total pipeline)
    
- ASP: **$110k** and target win rate of **13.5%**
    

From the 2025 YTD marketing-sourced opportunities:

- **Pipeline delivered**
    
    - **$12.7M** marketing-sourced pipeline **excluding StormForge**  
        → **141%** of the original $9.0M target
        
    - **$14.7M** including StormForge  
        → **164%** of the marketing pipeline target  
        → **124%** of the _entire company_ pipeline target of $11.85M
        
- **By quarter (vs $2.25M target):**
    
    - Q1: **$4.2M** (~185% of target)
        
    - Q2: **$4.8M** (~213%)
        
    - Q3: **$3.0M** (~135%)
        
    - Q4 to-date: **$2.8M** (~123%)
        
- **Year-over-year:**
    
    - 2024 total pipeline: **~$15.3M**
        
    - 2025 YTD (incl. StormForge): **~$14.7M** (**~96%** of last year)
        
    - This was achieved with **lower budgets and fewer resources**.
        

Net: Marketing has substantially over-delivered on the 2025 pipeline brief and nearly rebuilt last year’s volume with less fuel.

### 2. What actually happened in the funnel

From the same dataset:

- **Total marketing-sourced pipeline:** **$14.7M**
    
    - **Open:** **$6.1M** (~42%)
        
    - **Closed Lost:** **$7.2M** (~49%)
        
    - **Closed Won:** **$1.4M** (~9.5%)
        
- **Observed win rate (by dollars) so far:** ~**9.5%** of pipeline has closed won.  
    This is broadly in line with the **10% eventual win rate** implied by the new 20% / 50% progression model (20% to Stage 4, then 50% win from there).
    

Looking at stage progression:

- **Stage 1 → Stage 4+ (evaluation/proposal)**
    
    - ~**23%** of marketing-sourced pipeline dollars eventually reach a Stage 4+ equivalent.
        
    - This is actually slightly **better** than the **20%** assumption in the new model.
        
- **Stage 4+ → Closed Won**
    
    - Of the dollars that reach Stage 4+, ~**39–40%** have closed won so far.
        
    - That’s **meaningfully below** the assumed **50%** close rate from Stage 4, and there is still open Stage 4+ pipeline that could move either way.
        

So the data generally supports a **20% flow into late-stage**, but a **50% win rate from that tier is optimistic** versus what we’re seeing today.

### 3. Closed Lost: how far those dollars actually progressed

Focusing on the **$7.2M** in Closed Lost marketing opportunities:

- ~**25%** of lost dollars reached a mid-funnel Discovery stage.
    
- ~**12%** progressed into Prove/POC.
    
- ~**11%** made it all the way into ROI/proposal/negotiation before being lost.
    
- Roughly **51%** of lost dollars have **no recorded “highest stage reached”** in CRM at all.
    

This tells us two important things:

1. Real-world progression is **much less linear** than a clean 20%/50% funnel model.
    
2. Our **stage tracking is incomplete** for roughly half of the dollars we lose, which makes it risky to hard-code precise stage-to-stage conversion targets without first improving data hygiene.
    

### 4. New weekly pipeline goals vs what the math (and history) say

The new funnel plan sets:

- **$875k in new pipeline (Stage 1) each week**, and
    
- **$600k in new Stage 4 pipeline each week**,
    
- With the assumptions that **20% of Stage 1** reaches Stage 4, and **50% of Stage 4** closes.
    

There are two issues here:

1. **Internal inconsistency in the math**
    
    Under the 20% progression assumption:
    
    - To produce **$600k/week in new Stage 4**, we would need:  
        **$3.0M/week** entering Stage 1 (because $600k ÷ 20% = $3.0M).
        
    - With only **$875k/week** at Stage 1, the maximum Stage 4 you can get (at 20% conversion) is **$175k/week**, not $600k.
        
    
    The stated targets are only compatible if **~69%** of Stage 1 dollars make it to Stage 4, which is about **3× higher** than both the assumed 20% and the ~23% we actually see in the 2025 data.
    
2. **Required scale vs current run-rate**
    
    Based on 2025 YTD marketing results:
    
    - Marketing is currently generating about **$323k/week** in new pipeline and **$76k/week** in Stage 4+ pipeline.
        
    - The company-wide targets are **$875k/week** Stage 1 and **$600k/week** Stage 4.
        
    
    Even before we consider budget:
    
    - Marketing is at **~37%** of the **Stage 1** volume implied by the new model.
        
    - Marketing is at **~13%** of the **Stage 4** volume.
        
    
    If Marketing is expected to remain around **60%** of total pipeline:
    
    - Our share of the Stage 1 goal would be **$525k/week**, which is **~1.6×** our 2025 run-rate.
        
    - Our share of the Stage 4 goal would be **$360k/week**, which is almost **5×** our current Stage 4+ production.
        

Given that we are already at **141–164%** of the original marketing pipeline target for 2025 with **no budget increase**, it is not realistic to expect Marketing alone to bridge these multipliers.

### 5. Implications for 2026 and channel mix

Based on this year’s data:

- The **20% Stage 1 → Stage 4** assumption is defensible, possibly even conservative.
    
- The **50% Stage 4 → Closed Won** expectation is **aggressive** relative to the ~40% we are seeing.
    
- The combination of **$875k Stage 1/week** and **$600k Stage 4/week** is **not mathematically compatible** with those stage assumptions.
    
- Hitting these weekly dollar targets will require:
    
    - **Recalibrating the funnel math**, and/or
        
    - **Significant incremental demand from non-marketing channels** (partners, outbound, and sales-driven pipeline), not just “more of the same” from Marketing at the current budget level.
        

**My recommendation:**

1. **Reconcile the weekly Stage 1 and Stage 4 goals** with the stated 20% / 50% progressions, using the 2025 data as a reference point.
    
2. **Use ~40% as the baseline Stage 4 → Closed Won rate** in planning, with 50% treated as a stretch goal contingent on better qualification and sales execution.
    
3. **Set explicit pipeline targets by source** (Marketing, Channel/Partner, SDR/AE outbound) so that the combined plan rolls up to the new $875k / $600k goals rather than implicitly assigning that burden to Marketing.
    
4. **Improve CRM stage hygiene**, particularly the “Highest Stage Reached” field, so we can reliably manage to a stage-based funnel in 2026.
    
5. Continue to grow Marketing’s contribution, but recognize that we are already **well beyond the original 2025 mandate**; the next step-function in pipeline will need **incremental demand from additional channels** rather than expecting another 2–5× productivity gain from Marketing with flat budgets.
    

I’m happy to walk through the underlying data and assumptions live, but I wanted to anchor the 2026 plan in what we’ve actually seen from this year’s marketing pipeline.

**Subject:** 2026 Funnel Model – Flagging a Math Issue Before We Lock In

Hi [Name],

Before we finalize the 2026 funnel targets, I want to flag something I found when I pressure-tested the new weekly goals against our 2025 data. I think we have an alignment issue we should resolve. 

**The core problem: the Stage 1 and Stage 4 weekly targets aren't compatible with the progression assumptions.**

The new model sets:

- **$875k/week** in new Stage 1 pipeline
- **$600k/week** in new Stage 4 pipeline
- With **20%** of Stage 1 progressing to Stage 4, and **50%** of Stage 4 closing

Here's where it breaks down: if only 20% of Stage 1 dollars reach Stage 4, then $875k/week can only produce **$175k/week** in Stage 4—not $600k. To generate $600k/week in Stage 4 at a 20% conversion rate, we'd actually need **$3M/week** entering Stage 1.

For both targets to be true simultaneously, we'd need a **69% Stage 1 → Stage 4 progression**, which is about 3× higher than both the assumed rate and what we're actually seeing in the data (~23%).

**What the 2025 data shows:**

Marketing has delivered **$12.7M in pipeline YTD** (excluding StormForge), which is **141% of our $9M target**. We've essentially rebuilt last year's volume with less budget. So the team is performing well against the original mandate.

On progression, the data supports the **20% Stage 1 → Stage 4** assumption—we're actually slightly better at ~23%. However, **Stage 4 → Closed Won is running closer to 40%**, not 50%. That's a meaningful gap that affects the downstream bookings math.

**What I'd recommend we discuss:**

1. **Reconcile the weekly targets with the progression rates** – either adjust the Stage 1/Stage 4 goals to be mathematically consistent, or revisit the 20%/50% assumptions based on actual performance.
    
2. **Set explicit pipeline targets by source** – if the combined goal is $875k/$600k per week, let's define what Marketing, Channel, and Outbound each need to contribute. That way we're not implicitly assigning the full burden to one function.
    
3. **Use 40% as the baseline Stage 4 → Won rate** for planning purposes, with 50% as a stretch goal contingent on improved qualification and sales execution.
    

I'm confident Marketing can continue to grow contribution, but the next step-function will likely require incremental demand from additional channels rather than another 2–5× productivity gain from Marketing at current budget levels.

Happy to walk through the underlying data live. I just want to make sure we're building on a foundation that holds up mathematically before we commit.
