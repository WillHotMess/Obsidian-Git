3. **CMP - MSP Data Center + CSMP - FinOps**: 4 opps, $825K total, $825K open

## Key Wins & Learnings

### Successes
- **Pipeline generation exceeded target by 57%** - demand generation engine firing
- **SQL quality improved dramatically** with 136% of target achieved
- **Direct and Organic channels** producing highest quality leads

### Challenges
- **Only 1.1% of pipeline closed** - significant execution gap
- **14 zero-dollar opportunities** (21%) indicate data hygiene issues
- **Limited closed business** makes win rate statistically unreliable


## Q3 Starting Position

Entering Q3 with **$3.6M in open pipeline** provides strong coverage against the $2.7M quarterly target. However, the low close rate from Q2 demands immediate focus on execution rather than continued pipeline generation. Success in Q3 will be measured by conversion rate improvement, not pipeline creation.
