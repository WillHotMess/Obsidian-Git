Overall, we have 117 opportunities open worth $10,359,000

## Revised Annual and Quarterly Targets
Based on the updated annual target of $10,915,764 (approximately $2,728,941 per quarter), I've recalculated our funnel metrics while maintaining the same conversion rates:

1. **Revenue Model Assumptions**:
    - Average Sales Price (ASP): $110,000 per opportunity
    - Opportunity win rate: 15%
    - Annual **New Business** pipeline goal: $10,915,764
    - Quarterly **New Business** pipeline goal: $2,728,941
2. **Funnel Conversion Assumptions**:
    - MQL to SAL conversion: 94%
    - SAL to SQL conversion: 26%
    - SQL to Opportunity conversion: 76%
3. **Target Calculation Methodology**:
    - Starting with required annual pipeline value ($10,915,764)
    - Divided by ASP ($110,000) to determine required won deals (99)
    - Applied win rate (15%) to determine required opportunities (663)
    - Applied conversion rates at each funnel stage to determine required annual:
        - SQLs (131)
        - SALs (504)
        - MQLs (536)
    - Quarterly targets represent annual targets divided by four:
        - SQLs (33)
        - SALs (126)
        - MQLs (134)
