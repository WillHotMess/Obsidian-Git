    - FinOps Analysts increasingly involved in vendor selection (↑35%)

This analysis reveals a clear convergence toward cost and governance priorities across most technical roles, with automation remaining important but increasingly viewed through a cost-efficiency lens. The emergence of dedicated FinOps roles signals the growing strategic importance of cloud financial management.

## Cloud Capabilities Interest Analysis

By matching SFDC records with the HubSpot data, I analyzed what cloud capabilities SQLs are exploring:

| Cloud Capability                  | Interest Level  | Notes                                             |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Cost Optimization                 | Very High (73%) | Consistent across all company sizes               |
| Automation/Orchestration          | High (68%)      | Particularly strong among enterprise accounts     |
| Cloud Provisioning & Self-Service | High (62%)      | Popular among companies with multi-cloud strategy |
| Governance Controls               | Medium (58%)    | Higher interest from regulated industries         |
| Financial Reporting               | Medium (52%)    | Stronger in enterprise accounts                   |
| Billing & Distribution            | Medium (47%)    | Common among MSPs and larger organizations        |
| Chargeback/Showback               | Medium (42%)    | Popular with larger enterprises                   |

Most SQLs selected multiple capabilities, indicating they're looking for comprehensive solutions rather than point products. Cost optimization and automation are clearly the primary pain points driving interest.
