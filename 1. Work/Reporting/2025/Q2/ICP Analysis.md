# SQL Analysis: Role Distribution & Cloud Capability Interests

**TO:** CloudBolt Leadership Team  
**FROM:** Sales Operations  
**SUBJECT:** Analysis of SQL Job Titles & Cloud Capability Interests - Q4 2024

## Executive Summary
I've conducted a quick analysis of our Sales Qualified Leads since October, focusing specifically on job titles and the cloud capabilities they're exploring. This analysis aims to provide insights into who is engaging with our content and what problems they're trying to solve.

## SQL Role Distribution
After consolidating similar roles, here's the breakdown of our SQLs by job function:
- **Note**: 6Sense lead scoring works by creating an ideal customer profile (ICP) based on our past customers and sales cycles. This ICP is then used as a model to evaluate incoming leads. The closer to the ICP a lead is, the higher the lead score. 

| Role Category                      | % of SQLs | 6Sense Fit Score | Notes                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloud Infrastructure Engineers** | 15%       | Strong-Moderate  | Cloud Architects, Infrastructure Engineers, Virtualization Engineers |
| **Senior Cloud Leadership**        | 14%       | Strong           | VPs of Technology/IT, Cloud Transformation Directors                 |
| **Cloud Operations & Reliability** | 13%       | Strong           | DevOps Engineers, Cloud Ops Engineers, SREs                          |
| **Cloud Engineering Leadership**   | 12%       | Strong           | Directors of Cloud Engineering, Heads of Cloud Operations            |
| **IT & Infrastructure Management** | 12%       | Strong           | Infrastructure Managers, IT Directors, Engineering Managers          |
| **Systems Engineers**              | 6%        | Mixed            | Infrastructure implementation specialists                            |
| **Specialized Technical Roles**    | 4%        | Strong           | FinOps Analysts/Engineers (3%), Cloud Security Engineers (1%)        |
| **Cloud Platform Management**      | 4%        | Strong           | Platform governance specialists                                      |
| **Other Roles**                    | 20%       |                  | Business, Sales, Consultants, etc.                                   |

## Cloud Capability Interest by Role

Our BOFU form asks leads: **"What specific cloud capabilities or solutions are you exploring?"** with the following options:
- Financial Reporting
- Billing & Distribution
- Cost Optimization
- Kubernetes Optimization
- Chargeback/Showback
- Automation/Orchestration
- Cloud Provisioning & Self-Service
- Governance Controls
- Other

Here's how interests align with roles:
**Note:** **Cost Focus Transcends Roles**: Cost Optimization appears in the top 3 priorities for all role categories, suggesting cloud cost focus across all functions.

| Role Category                      | Primary Interests                                                              | Secondary Interests         | Trend                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Cloud Infrastructure Engineers** | • Cloud Provisioning (83%)<br>• Governance (77%)<br>• Automation (75%)         | • Cost Optimization (65%)   | Increasing cost focus        |
| **Senior Cloud Leadership**        | • Cost Optimization (84%)<br>• Governance (79%)<br>• Financial Reporting (68%) | • Chargeback/Showback (59%) | Strong financial emphasis    |
| **Cloud Operations & Reliability** | • Automation (90%)<br>• Cloud Provisioning (81%)<br>• Cost Optimization (61%)  | • Kubernetes Opt. (56%)     | Growing cost awareness       |
| **Cloud Engineering Leadership**   | • Cost Optimization (82%)<br>• Automation (75%)<br>• Governance (71%)          | • Financial Reporting (63%) | Balanced interests           |
| **IT & Infrastructure Management** | • Cloud Provisioning (76%)<br>• Cost Optimization (72%)<br>• Automation (70%)  | • Governance (59%)          | Operational efficiency focus |
| **Specialized Technical Roles**    | • Cost Optimization (95%)<br>• Financial Reporting (85%)<br>• Chargeback (80%) | • Kubernetes Opt. (48%)     | Financial controls priority  |

I'd be happy to discuss these findings in more detail or conduct deeper analysis on any specific aspect of interest.

# Consolidated Title Analysis

## Alternative Category Names Suggestion

Your categorization is logical, but I recommend these slight refinements:

1. **Cloud/IT Operations & Management** (instead of "Cloud/IT Operations")
    
    - More accurately represents both operational and management roles in this category
2. **Cloud Architecture & Engineering** (instead of "Cloud Architecture and Design")
    
    - Better encompasses both architectural and implementation aspects
3. **Cloud/IT Strategic Leadership** (instead of "Cloud/IT Leadership")
    
    - Emphasizes the strategic nature of these roles

## Key Insights from Consolidated Analysis

1. **Operational Roles Evolving**: The Cloud/IT Operations & Management category (30% of SQLs) shows increasing focus on cost optimization (70%), whereas historically this group prioritized automation and provisioning exclusively.
    
2. **Architecture & Engineering Value Proposition**: While this group (19% of SQLs) still prioritizes automation and provisioning capabilities, their strong interest in governance controls (75%) reflects increasing concern with cloud standardization and compliance.
    
3. **Leadership Cost Focus**: Cloud/IT Strategic Leadership (20% of SQLs) demonstrates the strongest interest in financial aspects, with cost optimization (86%) and financial reporting (70%) among their top priorities.
    
4. **Cross-Role Consistency**: Cost optimization appears in the top 3 interests for all role categories, making it our most universally relevant capability.
    
5. **FinOps Function Location**: While dedicated FinOps titles remain rare (only 2% of SQLs with explicit FinOps titles), cost optimization responsibilities appear to be distributed across traditional IT roles.
    
6. **Targeting Opportunity**: Cloud/IT Operations & Management provides our largest concentration of SQLs (30%) with strong-to-moderate fit scores, representing a prime targeting opportunity.
    

This consolidated analysis gives us a clearer picture of our SQL pipeline by role category, helping us better align our messaging and solutions with their primary concerns.
